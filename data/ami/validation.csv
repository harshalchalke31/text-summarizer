134,"Speaker A: Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls. If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing, that's gonna be quite a change. It might Mm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. But look at the importance of them. The volume settings. Yeah. They're not used often but they are quite important when they're used. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Hmm. Oh, you have to hit like function and F_ something. F_ eight. Dunno. Oh yeah, it's going. Oh yeah, they might be movable. Oh yeah, they're all they're not connected to anything on the table, you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em. Mm. Mm. Yes, mm. Which one does this plug into? That one. I can't did you could you see it on you screen when it That's not cool. Oh well. Anyways. Um alright, yeah, so um I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh. Oh there we go. Okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works. Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system, the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever. Um and it does this uh by well, you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television, the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do. Um and you need a user interface, which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it. Um Oh shoot. Okay. Uh just general findings. Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source, uh some sort of user interface, which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that. Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver. And um oops. Uh-huh. This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for. Uh this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons. Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb, which will be the part that actually what? Sends signals to the the television. And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there. And so my personal preferences I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out, uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in, so it'd constantly be charged, so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you. Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver, so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room, and the channel'll still be changed. Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it, so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions, as they inevitably do, you can find them easily. And that's pretty much it. Mm. Mm. Mm. Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years? Oh, cool. Yeah, fair enough. Mm, mm. Mm yeah. Mm-mm. Mm. 'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies. And that's pretty much yeah. Yeah, when it turns itself off, that's when I plug it in, yeah. Yeah, think that's a good idea. Mm. They usually have the little light uh source, I dunno what the heck they're called, the but yeah, the little cells that Yeah. Mm. Most of them, don't they have sort of a combination of the two, like when there is light, they'll work off the light, and if there isn't, they'll kick into this battery, so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery, but if there's enough light, then it's using the light, so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time, but you will have the battery there for when you need it. Mm. Mm. Oh, it depend if it's uh depends who who's using it, who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking, yeah. Yeah, then they're clicking a lot, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yep. Hmm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Cool.
Speaker B: Okay, welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group. Um I'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting uh just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals, because we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally, so uh. Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour. Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items, that switching was easy, that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular, um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting, that the keys might be concave, simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of. Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it, um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms. Um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls. Um and that it sh it should just always work, whenever you uh um mm uh use it. And that it shouldn't be too small, mm that it it gets lost. Um. Now uh uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations. Uh before I do that, however, I will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting. Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought. Um and and then we'll as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out, and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and I uh Anyway. Okay. Now, the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet. Um and and they want it only to cover televisions. Um now, what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover, you know, videos, D_V_D_s, um satellite boxes, which uh I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise. The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only. Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind, um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore, they certainly do look at other things. Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours. Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there, the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background. Um now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market. But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that. Um it also has to be simple, which to some extent goes along w with the first one, and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway. Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly, which um mm uh is is is their choice, but uh um we we need to talk that through. Um okay, so uh after the meeting it'll be summarised and uh um notes sent out and uh etcetera. Okay, so we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody. Um again I there is no order of precedence here um so I I I'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first? P fine. Oh sorry, you can indeed. Oh, if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen, no the one to the right of that. That one. Mm. Mm. Gosh, must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote, is all I can say. Mm. Right. Mm. Yeah, I must say that um the uh I c can't remember what um f you know phone service I was using the other day, but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well, so that is indeed a uh um a thought and it it cuts out uh I was was gonna say, you can't get a lot of R_S_I_, j just get jaw ache. Okay, sorry. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I mean Yeah. Mm. Hmm, hmm. Uh. Should we actually bite the bullet here? If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether. We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition, given that um the Um now the the age structure we were looking at um I mean w we had usage by age structure, what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups. Now do we know whether they Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group, uh to put myself right in the middle of it, um u use remote controls to a great extent. Yes we That would 've speech recogn right. So, we're looking at um well again, we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups. If we wanted something different, truly different, then the buttonless remote control w would be it. But if you just lift it up and say, channel one or B_B_C_ It c well it I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the, you know, the sound from the television, because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh, you know, I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself, so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it just to activate it. Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use. And and then just say, oh I don't know, a thought and and then uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different. Um 'cause uh you know audio settings, nought point eight percent. I mean if they weren't there, would people miss them? Vol volume, yes um th w we need to s identify things that people actually need and and it's a function of frequency and relevance. And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment, um the channel and volume and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext. Uh channel and volume are the only ones that uh would appear to be essential. Um. So we if we can design something that that looks interesting, know, or looks different, um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey, um and uh I dunno, buttons or or buttons as an option. Do, please. Mm-hmm. You cer certainly could. Depe uh i depends whether um if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say B_B_C_ one. Um okay, I mean you could print actually print it on the uh device itself. Um. S th this I th that's always gonna be a problem I think. Um and I I I s so I suppose one um could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one. Anyway, sorry, carry on. Do you want to just carry on with or no no, no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there. Mm okay. Mm-hmm. S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um 'cause we're Certainly could. Yeah, yeah. The I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper. No, it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh, you know, visually very distinctive. Um 'cause you know, it does not have to be a oblong box. Mm, yeah. Okay, who sorry, have you have you finished there Andy? Yep, yep. Um given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh. Ah, there we go. Alright. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm, yeah. Okay, can I um I'm actually gonna use the um it's gonna cause great technical problems over here. I'm actually gonna use the Yes, rather than the uh the the traditional in fact, um I won't even go that far. Um something like this shape, you know, sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape, um that you you sort of hold in your hand, um, well I'm trying to think uh uh uh l uh l such as I mean um something you hold up like that, possibly with a couple of buttons like that, but with the the entire top with the, you know, the uh the infrared or whatever source. Uh so that you know, it's flying off in all directions, so that uh um uh again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of um actually achieving that in terms of whether the, you know, the power requirements of the uh such a source, um you know, compromise the our our need for uh you know, it it being um mm permanently uh you know, available. Uh whether whether different technology um I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared, and like they have been for a long time. Uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different, um you know, short range, not like the old uh radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours. Um but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority, then we should, as I say, r know, really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum, you know, possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off. Um and nothing else. Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that, but again, except that um you know the risk of losing it. Um anyway okay um so Kate, wh what are your uh your thoughts on this? Okay. Uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we um I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one. Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls, particularly sort of independent ones. Um given you know, the number of things you buy these days, which you know, have a a a lithium whatever battery in, that's uh, you know never needs replacing. Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control, uh um you know, one some sort of typical usage. You know, the the the battery will last know, five, ten years. By which time I mean when all's said and done, the digital television will be taking over in that time scale. Um uh uh p perhaps we should, know, reduce the uh, you know, the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh Yeah, and if if anybody manages to run it down, we'll we'll give 'em a new one. Um it's, you know, it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a well, it's actually a marketing gimmick. I mean it's hardly a gimmick, it's uh it's totally practical. Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by, you know, magnetic waves or whatever, if if it Yeah. Are are people really gonna use it though? Um. I I th I think Yeah, it's um I mean I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now. Um. When it yeah, wh when it's died is a problem. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so uh um what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery? Is the uh you know, we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here. Um you know, cut cost within the manufacturing and uh you know, if we have a high tech interior, then then that that sh may well be cost effective. I mean th th certainly. Um I can't think of anything off the s top of my head, but there are certainly things that you buy. I mean calculators for example. Som well some do, I mean th th but there are battery ones that um are you know, sort of permanently sealed. In in fact I'd Yeah, uh uh Yeah, I I mean th th this needs going t into the technology a bit. I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating I would think is i is is probably, you know, no more than minutes in its entire life. Um. If, but I say if if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market n Right. Oh, I must admit I hadn't um I'd I'd missed that. That does sound excessive. Yeah. Well that's right, and and I I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed, or whether it's just a sorta tenth of a second, no matter how long you press it for, I don't know I don't actually know. Um. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Right, so I've got a message to say five minutes, I dunno how long ago that appeared. Um 'cause we're we're getting um right, so I'd I need to sum up very quickly here um. We're looking at extreme simplicity. We're looking at a radically different shape. Possibly no buttons at all um, but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design, then then that's fine. Um in the I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here, because, you know, shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint. But we clearly only need th the main buttons, although, uh if clearly only need the main functions. Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control, volume control and on off. Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo, uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers. Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed? Right. So uh Yeah. We are doing just the television. No. I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given, no? Right. Oh yeah well th that's one I s that's one I sent you, which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh what came down from from head office. Um That's that that that that's their uh their view. Okay, so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting, thank you very much indeed.
Speaker C: Uh I don't mind. Uh can I steal the cable? Cheers. I got a how do I start there? That one. Cool. Well these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab. Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see. Um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff. And general opinions about current current remotes. See that, as we kinda noticed, seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly. So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly. Uh along with um looking less ugly, if it looks better, eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it. Which is a a plus for us, if we can make it look better, it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up. Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user. I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um they they don't uh they, yeah, they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system, a digital box, a D_V_D_ player, a video player and T_V_. If it was uh I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour. Uh again, seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot. I took to mean that they just they use it a lot, they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume. And uh yeah, uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons, 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext, but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user. So I think maybe fewer buttons, which also make the design look sleeker, I dunno. Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control. I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate, but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control. Maybe like it'll beep or something. And um, yep, the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is Uh don't want to make it too complicated, easy to use for uh new like first time users and stuff. And uh repetitive strain injury, I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it, yeah, fewer buttons, like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable. Maybe don't even have to hold it as such. But uh yeah. It also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would. And uh there was another section on our on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays, but the data wasn't there, so. I don't actually know what the results for that were, so. May be incrementally emitting, but yeah. And uh it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you Yeah, um oh yeah, so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design. Oh, I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation. Um. You see this okay? Almost no? It's sorry it's a bit. I'll read out to you. Uh functionality, uh like people's opinions on functionality, the relevance to the remote and how often they're used. So um like the power. Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine, but it's not frequently used. You see what I mean? Whereas channel selection, which is very high relevance is used the most. So m we can maybe even start to cut down on or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use. Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something. So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings, which are low relevance and rarely used. And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily Oh yeah. Yeah, like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath. Just remove them completely? Uh yeah. Um no this is for pay more for speech recognition. Yeah, that's true. Or even I mean you could even just have it left on. You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to Yeah. B_B_C_ one. Oh yeah. Mm-mm. Relevance of two out of ten, yeah. Yeah. Stand out. Uh I just had a thought actually, sorry to interrupt. Uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation word. 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before, where you just you address the remote, you address the computer, and then give it a command. Oh I see. Oh yeah, I see. Mm-hmm, yeah. I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote. Mm. Oh no I I interrupted you, sorry. Oh okay. Um well, I was just kinda wrapping up there. Yeah, I was thinking um, yeah, maybe such things are relevant. We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better, combined with uh decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much. alright take out teletext, but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away. But, since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality. Oh, we could, yeah. We c yeah, we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time, so. So uh yeah, if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection, wouldn't have to really Yeah and probably it would look better as well. Yeah. yeah. Lined with numbered buttons and Uh yeah, yeah, that's everything. Do you want the cable? F_ eight. Uh, give it about twenty seconds, or so. Yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. It could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time. I suppose, yeah. Yeah. Uh. That sounds pretty good, yeah. Mm-hmm. W like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used, channel selection a hundred and sixty eight times per hour. Yeah. But then again, if you think it of the amount of, you know amount of use it's like That's it's less than a second, um. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, like in the email of television only. In fact they're in the constraints email that I got. Didn't you mention the teletext, just television only? Oh okay. Oh yeah.
Speaker D: Sorry. It could be oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use? Have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting, and then the numbers on one side, so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something. Yeah. That might be the Maybe i Yeah, have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are, you won't lose it. No. Oh. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Okay well, I can do mine. Yeah, let's see if I can make this work. Um. Oh. Is it doing Okay. Oh okay. Okay, so this is just about the technical functions. So the method, I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are, what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do. Um and then there are two different kinds that I found. There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be. So these are the two different ones. This one um this is the user centred, it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred, which has a lot more buttons, and probably this is one that people complain about, about having too many buttons that you don't use. So basically, what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set, you know, turn on, off, switch the channels and the volume and things such as that. And so for this product it's gonna be television only, and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours. And so, for my personal preferences, I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know, fewer buttons. Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have. It looks kind of narrow at the top, and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top, then that would be easier. Um and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different. E the unique style, maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark, um the changeable face-plates, and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it, maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that, so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that. So that's my presentation. Yeah. F they probably clip to you. Oh. Hmm I think it's all there. H Oh yeah. That's kind of strange. Yeah, people are pro I would think that people might forget I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there, so. Yeah. No. Um. Do they make batteries that last that long? Yeah, they have that little solar Yeah. Mm. Yeah, some people are Yeah. Yeah. Per hour? Wow. That's a lot. Yeah. Though I think with digital T_V_, like I know on my cable box, you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that, so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different channels that way instead of Uh-oh. Yeah. Um Oh I just have one question. So are we doing just the television or are we doing so not D_V_D_ players, we okay, okay. Okay. Yeah. Oh okay. Okay.","The project manager opens the meeting by going through notes from the last meeting, recapping the topics covered. He tells them some new project requirements given by management. The marketing expert presents, talking about user functionality requirements taken from research of 100 people. They discuss the possibility of making a remote that hides less frequently used buttons, one that uses voices recognition to eliminate buttons altogether, or one that combines the two functions. The interface specialist presents, showing examples of two different products- one that is user-centered and another that is engineering-centered and giving personal preference to the simpler one because it is easier to use and has fewer buttons. Next the industrial designer presents, explaining how a remote control works and giving personal preference to a remote which has a large energy source such as a rechargable battery or battery dock. The group discusses using a battery that will last 5-10 years or a solar combined with a battery. They briefly review their discussions and close the meeting."
1,"Speaker A: Hello. Good morning. Uh before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in, uh because we're uh being watched by uh Big Brother. So um Yeah. Yeah. This uh These are cameras, so are these. This thing uh that looks like a pie, are actually all microphones. So you must be careful with uh with uh all this. And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be. And that has to do with the camera settings, so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras. And Indeed. So they can see our faces. Okay. Welcome at the kick-off meeting. My name is uh Danny Wolfs. Uh this is the agenda for today. Uh first a little opening. Uh I will introduce myself, uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself. Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance, acquaintance to uh to to ourselves. So uh we get to know each other. Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards. Then the project plan. What we're going to do, and how we're going to do it. Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end. Okay uh, my name is uh Danny Wolfs. I'm the Project Manager. What's your name? User interface, okay. Industrial, yes. Okay, thank you. First a little about the project aim. Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control. Uh maybe you have read uh read the website. It's a very uh, yeah, very uh ambitious uh company. They uh they wanna do something else. I w Uh there must be a new remote control. Uh first of all uh it must be original, uh and trendy. That's two things really uh close to each other. But at the same time uh user-friendly. And they have uh Yeah, that's uh very important uh for them. Uh there are three stages. There is a functional design. So uh what are we going uh to uh to do? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote? And why are we going to do it? Then the conceptual design. How are going to do it? And that's uh really global. Uh because at the detailed design, how, part two, uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of If it's uh it's possible technical-wise. Uh each stage is uh uh is broken up in two uh two stages, individual work and a meeting. So it's uh it's very straightforward. Okay, the tool training. We have two smart boards. This one is for the presentations, the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had. Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing. So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme. This is called a smart board thing uh Yeah, it speaks for itself. Um and as you uh may have heard, the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen. Not in y the the My Documents. So if you wanna show something, put it in the shared folder. Uh This uh is very straightforward, with the save, the print, the undo, the blank, the select, the pen. Well, I don't uh gonna explain it all, because I think you know uh how it works. Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here, uh all must be saved. We we may not delete anything. So uh if you have uh drawn something, save it. Never delete it. That's a very important uh thing. Okay. Uh little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other. At uh the white board on the left. Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal, and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal. Uh important is that we use different colours, and uh different pen widths. Widths. Widths. Yes? Yeah. No no no. It's uh it's uh I I I must do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 'Cause we uh really don't know each other, and uh it's kinda new. So getting used to each other, we can uh have a little fun then, before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff. That kind of thing. Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal? Okay, okay. Yeah, okay. Drawing goes with uh this thing. Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here. That's uh important. So hold it uh like this. Yeah, kinda. So, um You must p p uh push a little uh Good. Because And uh wait uh wait a few seconds. It's not uh fully real-time, so uh watch it. Oh yeah. Well I'm gonna paint in the red. Oh. That's the background colour. Well, undo. Um The pen? No. One minute please. Yeah, that's the one. Well, five. Okay. My favourite animal huh? Yeah, you can guess what it is. May uh paint uh next. No, it's not an orc. You don't see it uh at the ears? You have an orc at home? Thank you. So it's a cat. Simba. 'Cause uh we have a cat at home and he's called Simba. 'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King. So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion. He's happy with us, so uh he's smiling. No, only the face. Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes. So we uh Yeah. Yeah. Okay, who wants to go next? Yeah? So choose a colour, choose a pen width and draw a Yeah. Save it, okay. Kind of firm touch. Yeah. Because uh my cat is red uh at home. And I have red hair, so uh must be red. It is a turtle. Why a turtle? Why? Tim? You watched it a lot? You watched it a lot? It's a scared turtle. Okay, Tim. Thank you. Jurgen, you want to go next? Format? And then you have the the current colour, you can change. So no red or green. And uh line uh width. I had five. Tim had Uh Tim, what kinda line width did you have? Okay. It's a dog. Okay. Why a dog? You have a dog at home? Had a dog? Yeah? Ah. You have an artistic uh inner middle. So I think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use. Not difficult at all. Okay, thank you. Janus? The last one? Yeah. After a cat, a turtle and a dog. I think he's gonna draw an elephant. Uh-oh. No. Better to draw with a with But what is he uh? Is it a rabbit? Do you have a rabbit at home? Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix. Okay, then yeah. Okay. Finishing touch and then we're going further. Yeah? Yeah, a little. Well, I think the dog is the the most uh artistic. Don't choose for youself. That's selfish. Okay, now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff. Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro, and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro. So uh from my point of view, I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech, high definition, uh ultra modern uh kinda remote, for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro. Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro. So that's a lot. We have to sell uh a lot of uh Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five, uh uh you got two million, two million remotes. But our marketing range is uh, market range is international. So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to. At least that uh countries which have uh a television. Um So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things. You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself, at home. What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature. What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others. Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little. I'm gonna join you at the table. Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control? Okay. So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and Or just only If you have them on uh I can uh Okay. Oh, in case you want it This is a dead kind of fly. Between the the the, yeah, the the uh Yeah, be The screens. No no no. Only All the drawings go there, at the left uh Oh, that pen drawings. Uh no, I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder, you can show it there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Five minutes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh remote? Yeah, it must be really uh innovative, technical-wise? Yeah. So yeah, I I agree with you. So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to Yeah. No. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. But we have to keep an eye that it's Uh at the beginning of such a project, it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about, well, this would be cool, that would be cool. Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh Yeah okay. Yeah. Okay. And that's because we have him. Okay, uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes. So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback, uh via the m the mail. Um the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design. Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions. So that's the thing we uh discussed. Yeah? Okay. Um wha Yeah. Yeah. But maybe, because uh you are working on the user requirements, you are working on the technical functions, we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh How do you call it? Uh Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do. So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all. Some basic things we co we want to going to do. Uh I think that's well uh Yeah. Will come in handy. Okay. W He says Yeah. Well, th that's that's really a step further. But if you say uh is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose, that's a Why? Why? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important. And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting. I must finish off now, so it's over. You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach. And I see you in uh thirty minutes. Thank you. Be careful.
Speaker B: Hi. Morning. Hi, my name's uh. I'm the Industrial Designer. By the way, why was your cat uh red? Oh, okay. Oh, yeah, sure. No, it's a turtle. Must be a dog. Yeah. Uh. Hmm. Yeah, sure. Uh thanks. I figure I should do something like that, but I'm gonna do something much more difficult. Exactly. Uh Yes. No. No. Yeah, exactly. So. Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit. Uh uh Uh well. Where does the pen go? Just uh Uh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive. Oh, sorry. Twenty million. Two million, oh yeah, two million. Yeah. And and him. I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually. Yeah. Yeah, actually it is. Then looking at individual components, so that's actually a f step further. Yeah, we can take it from there. Yeah, I agree uh, we can take it from there. Or edit. Okay, cheers.
Speaker C: Hi. Oh. Good morning. I'm Juergen Toffs. I'm the User Interface Designer. Ach. Ooph. Very artistic. Okay. Wow. He does have body uh Huh. You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing. Or You have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh Oh. Uh hmm. Okay. Oh. It's a very bloody cat. It's a frog. Uh it's an apple. A dog? Huh? Oh, it is a turtle. It's uh inside its shell. You'll be uh finished sooner. Wow. Yes. Okay. Wha Thank you. Yeah. Um How did it work? Performance? And a pen? Um Well, very good. I just uh thought I'd pick the easiest one. Well, we had a dog, a few years ago. And and it, yeah, when it died we didn't get a new one or something. But uh Uh a Graphical User Designer, so Hey. Oh. No. Can work together. Ah colour. Well, it's okay. Yeah. Uh-oh. Oh, he is the artistic design. Remote control animal. Well with the interface, it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh. Than on the, with Yeah, I m I mean like uh like on here, drawing drawing uh. And then displaying on screen, but Too expensive, yeah. A green rabbit. There, the g white green rabbit. He's a little bit stoned there. Yeah, how much is it? Hundred million uh remotes or something? Oh yeah. Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels. And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible. Uh Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen? Uh but um which The ones we made on the Oh, only in Word, okay. For what purpose? We And and the price. Okay. And him. Yeah. Um one thing uh, we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make. Do we Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems? Or uh We should have some agreement on that before we Okay. Ah okay. Consensus on the, what we're gonna do. Yeah. Well yeah, if the technical functions have to be designed, I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be. Or do we use it a text screen? Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Sorry. Yes. Yeah. No. Come up.
Speaker D: Good morning. By Big Brother? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Of our faces. I'm uh Tim. Um my function is the Marketing Expert. Speaks for itself. I have a question. Um this exercise, um did the company board tell you to do it, or uh did you just make it up yourself? It's part of the introduction, okay. Okay. Um, yeah. I don't know really how it works. But maybe you can show us first? You g you get electrocuted or It's like Pictionary? The the one who says it first gets a raise. It's a pork? Mm yeah, I have it at home. What's it called? Ah. Miniature size? Okay. Okay. We have to speed up. Remember you use uh different colours, and different pen widths. I Okay. Save it. You have to save it. I've done it. New? 'Kay. Mm uh Not really. Um That one. Yeah? Okay. Open. Which one is it? Smart board? Okay. And now? Okay. Okay, thanks. 'Kay, I've speed up. 'Kay, that's fine. Line width. It's not an apple. Hmm. Colour. Something like this. Smaller. Um 'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles. Uh? No, it's uh No no. It's coming up. Mm. Uh. Something like this. Okay, you know Very artistic. Yeah? Here you go. Uh the big lines were like nine. Uh, it's p It's pretty good uh An artist. Think you uh picked the wrong uh function. Wrong job. Wha That's enough, thanks. I wonder. I'm gonna design a remote uh remote control animal. Oh. Sorry. Yeah. That that might be easier. But at the other hand, uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand, and I think it's easier to draw. Yeah. With a pen than with a mouse mouse. Mouth. Oh, okay. Yeah. W with this paper it's too mu too expensive. It's a rabbit with uh broken legs? Yeah. It will do. Project Manager? Uh Have you been uh counting the time? Okay. Let's go on then. It's pretty abstract. Like how much? Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Uh but I have some points. Can I show them on the on the big screen? Maybe? Yeah. Yeah, I can find Uh. Screen? Okay. Okay, I have some uh points from marketing point of view. Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive, uh small, fairly cheap. Uh it's pretty cheap, twenty five Euros. Uh brand independent. Um I think, it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is. Um Five minutes? Okay, I'll wrap it up quickly. Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose. Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose. And uh by making it multi-purpose, it uh has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, and distinguish from uh from current products. Um maybe some other technology than infrared. Uh I rather find it very annoying um, like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it. Um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth. That might be a little bit uh expensive. Um And something like an L_C_D_ screen. Um uh like I said here um Maybe it's easy. It's nice as an added feature feature, that um, when you're on a certain channel, you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or From my point of view, yeah. Yeah, it has to be uh Yeah, our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things. So i i i i To the current market. Look, you got some cheap uh remote controls there. They just uh Yeah, you got a dozen of 'em. But when you enter a new market with a remote control and uh wanna gain market share you have to do something special, I think. Yeah. Yeah, of course. But it's But but this is just from marketing uh aspect. I don't know anything about user interface or design. Mm uh I I don't think we have to be, we have to agree on that. Uh I think th that's a pha Yeah. That's a phase further. Ju just uh make some mock-ups, some some general ideas. And and then we can plan Yeah. We can plan further, I think. Mm yeah. I don't know. You decide. You're the Project Manager. Uh tha that's a same step further. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it, or how it has to be like. And then in the next meeting we decide w what it's gonna be. A And then you s then you can delete uh the o the obsolete uh details. I think. Yeah. Yeah. Damn. Success?","The participants introduced themselves and their roles to each other. The Project Manager introduced the aim of the project and gave a brief agenda for the entire project. He then introduced and explained how to use the meeting-room materials. The group acquainted themselves with the materials by drawing on the smartboard. The Project Manager presented the project budget and explained that the device would not be made very high-tech due to the small budget. He explained that the device would be sold internationally. The group discussed their initial ideas of features to include in the design; the Marketing Expert discussed usability features, such as the ability to control multiple devices and an LCD screen, to make the product unique. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to work on the working design and the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions. The group discussed the timing of when they would make decisions on the features discussed."
92,"Speaker A: Can I close this? Oh, okay. There we go. Okay, here we are again. Detailed design oh, come on. Well Ah s Forgot to insert the minutes, but it's about the same thing we discussed before. Uh Could open that anyway, think. Other design anyway, we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time. We also that you're just busy with it. Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features. Well, we discussed the design, no sharp corners, we rounded it off, like you see on the other screen, which is fine. Um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black. Yellow in the back because it's m trendy, more trendy than black anyway. So then we ca yeah. We agreed that we would implement both the L_C_D_ and speech recognition, but I'll get to that in a moment. 'Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway. So so, like I said, we had no insight in finances, no prices, but we have 'em now, and it's bad. Anyway. We are Oh. Prototype presentation, well first you guys built the prototype. So you could could present that. But um let's see what be handy to do. Nee no, you just go ahead and present the w we'll scrap it later because What? Oh that's hasn't changed that much, huh? I didn't expect anyway. You just coloured it. Mm-hmm. I like the menu. Mm-hmm. And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber. It's it's part of the rubber, I suppose. I think that's more I think that's more durable anyway than printed on to Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Now it's my time to ruin everything. Well, not ruin everything, but no, nah. Finances, that's what we have here, what you drew. We have battery power, we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor. The sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway. So which you see the which is de o one of the most expensive parts. So well, we have sin one curve, a design. Rubber design. And we had a special colour. Suppose yellow is a special colour. So just half a Euro for You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display. You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost, which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use. So, easy. What do we scrap. Well think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition. Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side. There are ninety one percent of uh the people, or something like that. But ninety percent who favour an L_C_D_ display, and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition. I think it's also harder to. So I ju I took that out. So and so it's still stuck with thirteen, so I had to take out the special colour I suppose. And, yeah, I didn't see anything else I could take out. Yeah, I could take out the push-buttons, but we need those. So, generally what I came up with, in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros, spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it, we'll just then we'll do it in black. We'll just deliver it in black, have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have, and if you want it if you want the custom design, then you can buy the separate covers. You make it d orange or whatever you want. It was a big issue, but I'll just go back. Uh let's just let's see what okay, let's just see what we no, we we have to be under twelve and a half. It it's not uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half, so. I think you that's what you were ass assigned to do really, to to see how b th both those work together. So I think yeah, it's I think it's y one of the it's a good way to um to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too. Just keep you just make new covers for the for it, like we agreed before. And everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have. Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip. But we need that for the L_C_D_ display. Then again, we have the L_C_D_ display, which is also expensive. B yeah, but those go together. And yeah, we could take out the curve. Could we could take out the curve. Is that an option? For you? Yeah. I think it's it it does ruin it, but the fact that I t took that decision or t Took this example actually, not really decision, but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers. So you can change any colour you want. So it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want. You can take plastic, but I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls, because they're all plastic. So which in in turn Rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break. I al like I said, I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour, which would make this black a black and grey. Yeah, that's that that that's enough, because I guess those are the basic colours. So Oh. I think those are basic col They want to To ensure the profit. That that's th that's the order. We're just uh we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this. But that's not for our that's not our decision to take. We have a budget of twelve fifty per product. So Stick that. I don't think it's really bad either. I mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing to have I think they would do. Th I think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea, because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product, one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want. So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget. So Well I don't think Yeah. Is it worth is it is it does it mean anything to the customer? Like, it like, we don't care we don't care that you had to True, but we did we didn't get that. So I think it's it should either be a pack, maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something. But They could, but uh It's an option, but yeah, it's true. So actually uh it's not that much of an increase, but yeah. We cannot contact them. It's just the order that we got. So that's what we gotta go with. So it's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final, it's either turned into plastic, drop the squishy feel, make it make it more breakable, um or turn it yellow. So It's uh something we have to decide on. I say lose the curve. Oh that's true, we could lose the c yeah, I forgot that, sorry. Uh the curve. So That's just this one just d this is the banana curve. So this would this would be straight. No, uh no, that would be a curve inside the thing, I guess. No, would ju then it would just be a straight remote. Just like like that. Which would, yeah, turn it into something far more ordinary. we could make it yellow then, but You second that, you second that we lose the curve. Okay, yeah. So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world, so to speak. So we keep the curve. So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber. And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber, because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has. Mm-hmm. Yeah, um I guess people are willing to pay for that. So I think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control. So I think that would still make it a nice product. Okay, we're final on that. So it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing. But anyways we're here. Um yeah. This we discussed just now. That's just now just we could just discuss how the project went. I mean, was kind of I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way, but because you yeah, everything cannot be for free. We didn't I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time. Because that was I th it was really essential really to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost. So we just put something I think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually. So Yeah. Yeah, I think would have been. Materials would be ok at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that. So I suppose Yeah, let's see if it sells. I mean I suppose this sells, because it's very very extended. But I suppose it sells, because it's good. I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price, because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway. Okay. Have been met, okay. Yeah. They're stuck under menu. For the menu. I think those are totally met, because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want, they have the simplicity they want. I think it's very uh very well met. Either two or one maybe. I think we took that everything they wanted into consideration. So it could either be a two or a one. One and a half. Just create our own option. Yeah. It's perfect. Even for deaf people, yeah. It's I don't think it's perfect, but we did everything possible to to get it back. Because if it's stuck in you couch, you can see the light. Maybe you can hear it. But I mean we tried, so I think it that's that deserves a one. Definitely. I'd use an remote control. It's pretty straight-forward, uh-huh. I think but we didn't even there was no issue on making a manual actually. We didn't really discuss it, but I don't think it takes no, it really does doesn't take time to learn, I think. We took it s it's so easy, we have so little button, everything speaks for itself really. So I think that's yeah, we didn't it's either two or one, I guess. Maybe it's a two, because d uh the L_C_D_ is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button. So I might make this a two instead of a one, I guess. So just make that a two. You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way. I think so. I think it's perfect, the w where it is, what it can do, if it useful. I think so. No, y I mean in the L_C_D_ screen, the small screen. What does it display? Well I thought it was I thought it was I thought that people wanted previews on their I'm not sure if that even possible, but 'cause it's this requires a quite quite a bit of band-width. I don't think it's possible really. But the they didn't really define in what should be used for. But I think in for example like T_V_ guides, I think that's that th that you can transmit through it and everything. Just for extra information on your programmes. But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example, how do you configure that. So that could be done by L_C_D_ display. I think it's good. No, maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly. We didn't give it I don't thing over-discussing. Now we gave it enough thought though. I think we d should just lower this. Maybe maybe it's a three though. We could've used it more effectively probably. Yeah, we are using it, but it's not it's not poorly used, but it's not efficiently used, I think. We could have ev even lost the selection button and uh done everything via L_C_D_ selection. It's now it's just extra to illustrate im uh extra features, but okay. Can you talk to remote control? Well, it can't talk anymore. So we scrap that. Oh yeah Just to be a prick, but of course you can talk to your remote control, it doesn't do anything. But you c you can talk to it. Well, we did take everything into consideration of course. Uh the shape i shape is i I think we yeah, I think that's okay. Yeah, special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable to the fashi We don't have it we do have it, it's just sold as a package. It does it's not part of the basic product. It that that's what I call trendy. I mean the shape is trendy. The the sh the the functions are trendy. It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model. Because you ha it's just not affordable at the moment. It's possible, but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour. Overall score. One two three. sixteen. Two two point some two point something.. Two and two thirds. It's okay, but that's yo m mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition. 'Cause yeah, that gives you a seven, which ruins your your average. Without that it would be like under it wouldn't yeah, it would be under two. So I think we have even with this it's reasonable. Well I think it's two is okay. Yeah, two is pretty good. Definitely. Yeah, I think it's probably I I do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display. We could have used it more efficiently, we just didn't think of it that way. So like I said, changing channels, everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display, so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything. I think we div I think we did very well, uh ev even if you look at this score, we did quite well. It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved. So. They sh they should get kids, and just stick 'em in T_V_ and say change the channel. I don' think so. Uh it's just not it it's not affordable. Or your sh you should lose the L_C_D_ screen probably, but I think that's I think the L_C_D_ screen is more worth than speech recognition. Definitely. Okay, that was that. So that's the final product without the speakers, I guess. Let's see, what was left in the the Another one. Hmm. Yeah, we evaluate the product. General project, what's i in For example, I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created. We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example, which I thought was pretty creative, because it was never never ever listed somewhere. Well Anyways. Yeah, leadership is up to you. I mean perhaps I screwed up because I d put a put a speech recognition into it. But that's not for me to decide. I think we did pretty well as team-work though. Because, yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime, because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results, initially of course I wanted to contact you. Say, look, this is you're doing the wrong thing, you're s you're wasting your time now, because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford. So it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh because that's that's what would w you what you would normally do, either call or email someone. So that was too bad con was impossible here anyways.. It didn't have or didn't knew what they costs or whatever. There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them. So that was a little unclear I suppose. I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool. I think uh s especially for design issues, it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them. It's a little less it the response time is le it's very bad. It's good to visualise everything, but I think the response time should could be a lot better. Definitely. Yeah, it's true. No, you don't have to. No, you don't. I jin I didn't check the finish button. I just you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever. Uh only if you uh check the notes or press done. Then it um then you can then it exports to Word automatically. But it's not necessary to check either one of those two. You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme. Okay, before starting a ne a new page. Okay, that could be b. Okay. Yeah, okay. That's Yeah, it's understandable, okay. Any new ideas? Yeah, more communication between between uh that's the thing I noticed, that communication is very um very important, because if you get new information, it's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible, because you would avoid making doing extra work, because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition, you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side. So I think that could have been better. But that's I think it's more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh than somewhere else. So Yeah, I think so. And l less p less spam probably. I'm not sure i I'm not sure you got spammed as well, but I get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a there was another email about master classes or something. So which were totally useless actually. I thought I should probably look into them, but they were all useless. So I just Oh okay. I didn't have any uh more information, it's just always the same here. So that's that's kind of a It would change, but not for me. So I'd I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually. I couldn't do any research myself or I see, that's yeah, w I could have done a little extra work probably, then But I was busy enough anyway. So Any new ideas found? Or is that a 'cause uh yeah, it's well, probably is. I have no clue. That's like oh,but it Should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget, we should celebrate. So Uh okay, think that's about it. Uh I'm not sure what we should still do though uh t let's see what all your tasks were finished, right? What you ha from your assistant. So let's Okay, I should I think I sh I still have the the total report to finish up. I think we took very little time now, because Yeah, we're in agreement, everything the design is okay. The one thing we missed though, we don't have a product name. How about you cook a how about you cook up a product name? Just oh, think of a catchy name. I'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps. So What? Fruit? You don't want it to resemble a banana. It's not yellow anyway. It's not yellow anymore. It is curved, but No, it's Hmm. Real Reaction future R_C_. Step into the future of of remote controlling your T_V_. No that's a that's a catchy slogan. Control your remote control. I go for future R_C_ probably. Something like It's short f Real reactor? Uh that that's That makes me think of different products than a remote control really. I'm not sure. Real reaction in a real Real reactor. Didn't notice. Mm. I take f yeah, take a banana. Hmm. No, not like that. It should be it should be longer, because it's not a product name that you f print on a box. Just write out triple, like a word triple R_C_, triple stripe Oh. Triple dash R_ dash s s C_. Yeah. R_ dash C_. Dash. Triple R_ or triple R_C_? How about do both? Sure if it looks stupid. Uh I think that the the R_C_ together takes away the the the image of it's a triple Uh the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control, but it's only a single remote control. And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important. The Real Reaction Remote. Yeah, triple R_ yeah, you can Yeah, triple R_. Banana remote. I think we're all in agreement about the triple R_. I think triple R_ is cool. And it looks cool when you print it in font, looks pretty cool. Just like this just and you just print triple R_, it looks doesn't look bad, it's short, it's okay. So have to write my report now, I guess. Um Um Yeah, so we have everything. We have the product, we have the costs, we have the possibility of everything. Okay. I think it's adjourned. Retire to my lair and finish the report. That was a short meeting. But efficient though. Probably. See. Okay, goodbye. Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report?
Speaker B: Hmm. Hmm? Mm yeah. Okay. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Pushbut Special colour, yeah. Yeah, it The p And the p What. But uh the and Yeah. The people Spongy, yeah. Yeah. And But But The people want to pay for for it, so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half? Yeah. But we can take a risk. Okay, yeah. I hope the people will like it, but Yeah. Yeah. The first sheet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's better. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. And I want to do that. Yeah. Yeah. But Let's um see um Um Let's Uh Oh. Hmm. Okay, let's eval evaluate uh the product of us, our design. Um I have some uh a method, a requirements and scale of. I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not. And I will uh make a new blank sheet. So so the buttons, the look and feel. I thought it was okay, but the advanced uh settings, um screen, audio and channel We are not Oh the menu button is it. Hi Oh, okay. Then it's all uh S it's true. Yeah. So d Oh wait. Uh pen. The p Oh yeah, it's red, okay, but Look and feel is everybo it's true. So Anyone? And the next one uh yeah, when it's lost uh you can find it. It's Yeah. And it's and it's yeah. To. That's okay then. And the next one. How is that? Uh w we had we don't have an uh manual, yeah. But I think that's a part of it. But Yeah, an L_C_D_, it tells a lot about uh Yeah. So it's a one or a I don't know. For the advanced uh settings. No okay, that uh that's true. Oh, so it Takes no ti Yeah. And the L_C_D_, you have to see it. Um mm Oh, it's a little bit learning. Okay. Uh yeah it's uh a little bit same. But it tells you or not? But wha w oh, yeah. What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen? Just uh only the channels and or What uh? Oh, in the L_C_D_ screen. And for a channel selection, uh or that's not Yeah, I thought I thought too but yeah. But Maybe a T_V_ guide or something in your L_C_D_ uh Yeah. Yeah, it must be clear then what what what for we use it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, indeed. So everybody's agree with an uh three on it, it's W Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I A three. Ah, nothing, that's A seven. Uh that's uh Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Not with the speech recognition. Uh yeah, all the trends and no colours uh anymore. So Yeah, uh um only in the curves. But the colours, we don't have special colours on it. Yeah, but we yeah, we don't have it, so d In the end product. Now But it's not a one. Yeah. Oh. Oh well Oops. Oh it's a two, right? On the last one. Uh that n that's all. Overall. It's um ten, sixteen three uh two two point seven or something like that. I don't know why. Six. Um So we can say it's it's the product is it's okay. Y not Yeah. Woah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, with. The scale. Yeah. With an L_C_D_ screen. Yeah, you can make 'em another one. Yeah. Yeah. Favourite channel. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah, you're working separate. Yeah. Yeah, yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Direct uh communication with yeah. Yeah. My handwriting is little bit yeah. Yeah. But th that's Yeah, okay. No. You can Done and then it's okay. Oh, okay. Okay, yeah. Okay. Oh. Hmm. Important to mm Yeah. Mm Yeah, after After five minutes, uh Yeah. Email uh it's Yeah. I want one for my own. Yeah. Yeah, my personal coach i What Yeah, name. Or fruit name. Fruit name or something like that. The banana remote or something. I don't know. Yeah, it's the form of it. Yeah oh, yeah. Uh yeah. Uh Yeah. That's true. Reaction, Real Reaction... Zapping. The Yeah, sure. The banana. Remote. Banana recei R_C_. Remote. R_ three C_. R_ three C_. Real Reaction Remote Control. R_ three C_. Oh yeah. Yeah, triple R_. Triple R_C_. The triple R_C_, yeah. R_ s R_ three C_.. Triple R_ dash. That Yeah, this yeah. Triple remote. Yeah. It's okay. The banana. Banana. Yeah, the deluxe. The r triple R_. Yeah. It can't work. That will not Okay. Damn. I will write that one in a Word uh document. Oh sh Um Yeah, okay, I will ask you when uh I need the information. So it's oh. Uh Oh. Merge. Sucks. Yeah, but I don't know. Smart no. Ma it's maybe it's not on the network of uh the rest. That one is.. Yeah. Okay. Oh yeah,. Can I see scores? Uh, one one, two threes, two Okay, then we'll overall, two points. Yes. Yeah. Mm.
Speaker C: I think it's more or less the same as we had. No much s No no no, not at all. Hmm. Yeah, of course. That's uh the integration story again. No, uh this is just a description of what we see there. So Speaks for itself. Hmm. I d Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Huh. Okay, but there's another problem. But there's another problem. If we take another cover, for instance black, then we also need another button frame, 'cause black and black doesn't work obviously. Huh. Huh. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Right. I agree. Mm-hmm. Or say let's lose rubber, take plastic. Yes. Although we are demolishing a little bit the style. But Yeah. Can we then not also uh change the material? We take plastic for the basic cover and We can put those to the to the other covers. That's true. But okay. But what do you then suggest we'd lose? Because we have to lose two things and I guess. Yes. Okay, and that's enough? Hmm. Hmm. Perhaps we should make m Huh. Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost. And that's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost, that they know that. Perhaps they decide tha Of course. Perhaps they uh no, but perhaps they think uh okay, the cover is such a nice idea, uh let's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs. We ca we uh we can at least tell them that You don't know that. Huh. No, I'm not uh talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this. We could at least m uh make it like this, like you said, and then tell them okay, we had to drop this and that, just that you know. It is an still an option, but not for this price. Exactly, but Hmm. I'd say lose the curve and the colour and Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh. I agree. No. Hmm? Yes. Huh. Hmm. Me too, I felt a bit blind throughout the project, because in the beginning I had no list of available materials, and then I d had not list of available c finances. So Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. One. Hmm. Manual. I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control, but then again, it's for young people. So Yeah, I th Exactly. No, that's true. I think it won't be a big problem. Ah. Um With the more important functions on. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. the menus uh Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu, because we have no buttons for those. Yes. Mm. Yes. Nah, it's not really only an extra. No menus. Think about Hmm. But M Changing covers is also trend that we followed. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Six. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm, of course. Mm-hmm. But I think for this price, this is it's really a reasonable product. It's a good product. Oh. Oh. Yeah. But if pep people really want speech recognition, then they must be prepared to pu to pay more, because it's cannot be done for this. Hmm yeah. Ah but for this price uh you cannot ask that. You cannot th think of that No, it's not. Mm-hmm. Oh It's also more attractive. Hmm. Yes. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Huh. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. That's the same thing that I had in the beginning. Everybody was using materials that s I didn't have. So Oh. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. But there's uh also one problem with this I noticed. Uh you have to finish a page before going to a n Oh. Okay, I saw that uh Hmm. Yeah, but I made Okay, but I made three pages and they were not finished. And when the third one was finished, I wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore, because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further. Exactly. So we cannot work on more than one page at same time. That's not possible. You have to finish it completely, then download it, it's then start a new one. That's not very uh handy, but if you know that, then it's not a problem. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah. Well Hmm. Huh. Yeah.. Yeah, Mm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. No.. Okay, bring out the beer. I have no more email. My coach is uh being very silent now. No, we haven't think above about that. Huh. It's better than thi I think than a serial number. Sony uh T_R_ something uh f means nothing to me. Uh Like fruit names. Uh at least it's not something with numbers. Numbers are so meaningless to the people. I mean. Real Reaction. Real react. The Real Reactor, I don't find that uh that bad at all. Yeah. Because our name is Real Reaction. I'm looking for things in the name. So that the first three letters are s the same. R_E_A_ R_E_A_. The triple R_. Real Reaction remotes control. Triple R_.? yeah. Yeah, that.. I think triple R_. Doesn't sound? Yeah. Ah. I think I like it like this more. Hmm. Mm. I would huh. I would lose the C_ and just name it triple R_. It sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it. I would just say triple R_s triple R_ That's also short, catchy. Banana.. Yes. did you do now? Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Mm-hmm. The boss is always the last one to go home. So See you in a minute. Okay. Can't we take this one? Otherwise we have to do it all over again. Is it okay if I try? Is that okay with you? I'll put it back in a minute. Okay, it has been saving something, but where to I don't know. Oh, can I say exp yes, I can. Export as J_ PEG.. Okay, can I not put this wherever I wants. My document is the wrong one, huh. I cannot. I don't think so. Document and settings. That's a pity. That means that we have to gonna draw it again. Are you gonna do that? Okay. That Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes, that's correct. Okay. No. Oh, it's export. Okay. Oh, of course. Sorry.
Speaker D: Uh we don't have any changes, do we? So no. It's basically what we agreed upon, but just a little bit more specified. Uh s Final design. Basically in what we discussed, cover and buttons will be made of rubber, yellow colour, black components, as you can see right over here. We chose a different type of colour for the menu. A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad. If you put them all black, it's not really that good a contrast. So Probab Yeah. That's the be And it I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to uh So we have it's a bit round shaped, that's what we had uh We chose the buttons to be uh teletext, okay button, favourite channel and the mute. So that's basically what we chose there. If you have anything to add, please interrupt me. Oh. That's pretty much it. Oh sorry. I'd say that too. Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample, which you can't do with a normal remote control, which people already do. So Well, I'd I tend to disagree with you on that, because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this. So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen? Okay. Yeah. We do. We could take out a curve indeed. I think the colour is more important than the really the curve, because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control So black and grey is okay. Which we can fabricate, okay. No, we basically We need to stick to that. But they don't Well And if we So which curve is that ba that's basically that curve. So we could u still have the comfort. I second that. No, that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control. So that's not really that I would Yeah. I would say I would agree with you on the colour, because that's an extra option, an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money. So we can always do that. Which is basically what we discussed. Yes, we could have Well I hope it sells. Which are basically accessible through the menu button. Yeah. Which is not an option. To make it that way, yeah. Mm yeah. And it's pretty straight-forward, you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the L_C_D_ menus. So One I d no, actu No, it it is pretty straight-forward. Yeah. Yeah. Well, basically the menu options indeed. But No. Yeah. Yeah. Two or three. So You can seven. Or we could say it Or we could say neutral, we 'cause we scratched the C No, we don't have the colour. So I Yes, but the end product So Maybe we should go with a two then, because it's not perfect, because we can't do it initially, but we Yeah. Overall score. Ten, sixteen, divided by Is two two third. There's Yeah, if we make it into a four, as in neutral, because we didn't implement it, so we can't say that we that it's really not well implemented. We come out on a average of two one eighth. So which is pretty w good. It's at least on the positive side. So We could definitely have done better if we've had more resources, but Yeah. True. So did you Yeah. And we could share information which we received. Yeah. Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher, because The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that. So Oh can you? Okay. Yeah, well it could also possibly be well, is it a more real-time information base, so we can all see which information is available to one another. Well, I personally did not have that, but That's probably your l description. But I also didn't not really. But still, you had that as well. Is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website, and then there was just extra information. There was a little delay in the bit of a c crucial delay. How much time do we have for this anyway? Yeah. Champagne. Product name. The bana 'cause it's not yellow anymore. Well, uh I was going for the R_C_ deluxe, but it's not really a catchy name or anything, it's more Something with our company name, can we do anything with that? Maybe there's something on the website which will help us out. The reaction deluxe. Is that a name or a c campaign? Yeah. Or the The real reactor. You should write it down as a an option. So that's one option. Should I write the banana down or Sure? Well I Uh do you mean it like You mean it like this? Dash C_? Like a C_ right now or a dash in a C_? Is it triple R_C_s? No. Well, that's another option. Okay, so which ones are we going to scratch definitely? I say this one as well. Triple R_? Triple R_ it is. Yeah, sure. I don't really know whether we can save it as a picture or no. Sure. Network places. I wouldn't pick that one, no. Sure. Oh. I see you later.","Detailed design Prototype presentation , well first It's basically what we agreed upon , but just a little bit more specified . Basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow And it I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber So we have it's a bit round shaped , We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute . We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway . we have sin one curve , a design . Rubber design . And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour . You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample , Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side . so I had to take out the special colour I suppose . and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , we could take out the curve . I think the colour is more important than the really the curve , but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers . Can we then not also uh change the material ? We take plastic for the basic cover something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the We can put those to the to the other covers . Rubber would increase durability so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ? and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company But we can take a risk . that's not our decision to take . I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . but the one that g has given us the order to design this . and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an still an option , but not for this price . yeah , it's true . So that's what we gotta go with . just to get it through final , I say lose the curve . Oh that's true , Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . I second that . So we keep the curve . And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , we're final on that . because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has . we could just discuss how the project went . I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time . Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , because it's good . I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price , let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design . I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false So so the buttons , the look and feel . One and a half . And the next one uh yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it . so I think it that's that deserves a one . Definitely . And the next one . Manual . I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , it it is pretty straight-forward . What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ? Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu , I thought that people wanted previews on their I don't think it's possible really . uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . So that could be done by L_C_D_ display . A three . I mean the shape is trendy . The the sh the the functions are trendy . It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . Maybe we should go with a two then , Overall score . Two and two thirds . mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . 'Cause yeah , that gives you a seven , I do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display . We could have used it more efficiently , like I said , changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything . For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . I think we did pretty well as team-work though . Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool . I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them . Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that . The one thing we missed though , we don't have a product name . And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important . The Real Reaction Remote . Triple R_ it is . have to write my report now , I guess . Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ? Yeah , sure . What do we scrap . Yeah . I would say I would agree with you on the colour , So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess . You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible ."
104,"Speaker A: Hi everyone, hope you had a nice lunch. Um. Alright we're moving on to conceptual design. Um, I'll just review what we did in our last meeting. Um, under marketing we targeted our audience, and Um, yeah. That was generally how helpful that was. Um, then we considered some design options with how it should look, um, we discussed an iPod-like button system which, uh, we haven't concluded but we're Right, um So, if you all have presentations to do, we can see what where you've come from our last time. Does everyone have presentations? Okay. Would anybody like to go first? Okay. And why not wood? And why not wood? 'S good. Hmm. Mm. I think it's the next it's the blue one, yeah. Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control. Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time. You need a screen for it? We're, um, we're actually not having D_V_D_, that was one of th I I was sorry, I I meant to update you on that. Um. Yeah. Yeah. You've Yeah, I know what you're saying, you have to But but imagine someone with s But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels. Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah I mean with that many options, you'd uh I'd think that the screen would be better, because you could have that menu option, sort of Yeah. Yeah. Uh. Mm. Mm. Yeah. So the T_V_ is the screen, that yeah So it would have all these different options of changing to Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Um, right. What if I mean, if you're thinking of the design of it now, like the a you know, physical attributes, um, and you just have this, it's like just a long silver thing, or whatever we're thinking. I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing? Or Yeah. So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before. I mean okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb, yeah. Yeah. But, were there buttons on there as well? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. What if, um, you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much? Like you so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it. Do do you know what I'm talking about though? Like, uh, yeah just something Yeah, that you can flip over, yeah, yeah. Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing is is if w I if we can do this, that'd probably be Yeah, yeah. So I guess we have to look into the, um, like, the programming, how this how they actually programme these things, and if that's yeah. I mean it would y would that would be Huh. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, you don't know they mean, yeah, it's like yeah. Mm. And it is technologically innovative in a way, so that fits with the B Yeah. Oh god. Ah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean definitely the area round it. Yeah. An orange. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what if what this is I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking. If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand, so like what you're feeling is comfortable, and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is. And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. Is that kind of I 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours. Um I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just the feedback we've just got about the A ball? Yeah. This is just Okay. Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit. Squashy. That see I was thinking this s sorry I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing. And like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there. Um but I was thinking if it was like this 'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy It's almost like your thumb is farther up, so if if you could squish it lower then Yeah, I know what you meant, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Well that's not very neat, but Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. It was, yeah, silver and yellow. It l it looks like I don't Yeah. I mean that's another question, where are we gonna we we should have the logo somewhere on it. Yeah. Yeah, th and that would that Mm-hmm. I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me. But if someone components concept. Question mark. Energy. Question mark. Was that you? Okay. Oh right right. Yeah. Um, so what d but what do we know about energy? I mean we're gonna use batteries right? And I think batteries sound good. What does everyone else think? What about Kryptonite? Yeah. What does chip on print mean? Uh-huh. Okay. Right. So, chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced. Okay. And case? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about, yeah. Casing. Yeah. thinking of like syntactic case and thi um let's see. Is there anything else we need to talk about? Oh when we move on, you two are going to be playing with play-dough. Um, and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design. And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation. So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach. Mm. See you soon. Does it matter that I end early? How how early is it? I didn't get a pop-up thing that said
Speaker B: Hmm. Yes. Sure. So I've been looking at the components design. Um. Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting. Um, so we need some custom design parts, and other parts we'll just use standard. Um, I assume we'll be custom designing our case, probably a hard plastic or some other material case, to protect the remote and the locator. And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board, because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time. But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out. Um, standard parts include the buttons and the wheels, um the iPod-style wheel. The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it. Um, we need a radio sender and receiver, those are standard. And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote. So we have some material options. Um, we can use rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. Um, I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy. Um, and the rubber case requires rubber buttons, so if we definitely want plastic buttons, we shouldn't have a rubber case. And, hmm? Uh, well we can use wood. I don't know why we'd want to. Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button, it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip. We can't use the minimal chip, we need the next higher grade, which is called regular. I don't think it's much more expensive, but it is more expensive. So that's what I've got on design. You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song, like you know that band or whatever. With T_V_ channels it's, you know, one two three. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My flatmates actually had one with a wheel, and it it did show up on the T_V_. They have to r wheel really fast. But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels, at least on theirs. It's more expensive according to the design people. You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal. Mm-hmm. Yeah. W when we had the wheely remote control, we it was on the top I think, if you held it like that. Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do. So we just used the top part. Yeah. Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of Yeah. Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_? I don't know. I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_, not inside the remote. I'm not sure. Well they usually are. Well I guess that's right. It always comes with the T_V_. Yeah, it most of the ones we've had have had the menu button, 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something. 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Or on the T_V_ too. Oh, I was gonna say. You said uh people want spongy. Um, one of your one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in like those stress ball things. So, that would be spongy. Yeah I think it could work. Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana. You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit, apple machine and they have like the blueberry, like all the colours are named after fruits. Oh. Mm. I was thinking sort of a single ball shape. So you're holding a squishy ball and then it has a Mm-hmm. Yeah I guess so. Yeah you could squish it. I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front, or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath. I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case. Especially if you're switching out the squishy part. Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off. Well I dunno. You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand. Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again. That was me. Yes. Uh we actually had an option of batteries, solar power, and um a dynamo, which is something I don't know what it is. Something to do with torches. Oh okay. Yeah, the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself. So I sort of picked battery. We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power. Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways. It it seems a little weird for a living room anyways. Didn't have enough data to actually All it said was it gave sort of relative, some chips are more expensive than others, sort of things. It didn't give me any actual cost. Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk. So I don't think it's that much of a problem. Like the chip is probably the most expensive part. Um, for things like remote controls, um, they stamp out a chip, calculators too I think. Um, so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap. But it's not like a computer, you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls, it's like stamped onto the chip. Yeah. Case is what we were discussing yeah.
Speaker C: Bless you. Yeah. Um, can I do next? 'Cause I have to say something about the material which is quite shocking. Ha. Mm. Right, um, I have been searching the current trends, um, both on the web and via fashion-watchers, and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh, fancy look and feel. Um. Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that. And th last thing is the easy to use um factor. Um, fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing, but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use. Um, our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided, well noticed, that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want, you know, wh whatever our motto is. Um. For fashion, we go for fashion. The fashion in electronics. So we want to put the fashion electronics, we need to go fruit and vegetables. And also go for a spongy feel, so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer. As to the material should be limited to I don't know how spongy it can be, should discuss this together, I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go. Um. I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables, but that's just a personal opinion. I think I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room. Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed, so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit? Um, and finally again with the spongy. It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that's better than mine. Um, yeah, to summarise these are the points that need to be um, touched in order to get a good decision, and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter. Thank you for your attention. Neither was I. Well it's a trend in fashion, in clothing and um fabrics. But the screen can come up on the telly, the she said. That correct? Graphical interface? Uh on the you can have it on the telly though. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Look it even has settings. On the you can just take theirs and just Yeah but should be comfortable. Yeah I use it like that. Yeah. Uh. Well you can have it on the settings, no? They already do it. No. But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out, because the problem with buttons is you like, they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand, and I never get it. Never ever. So Well on the telly. Mm. Did you did you get that pc picture on did they provide you with that picture on the web? That's quite interesting. What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just nice feel, but I hate spongy. Well it could be like mobiles that just you just put a cover. If it's a small thing, you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana, which frankly I'm not particularly fond of, um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing. You know you had there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And it could the colour can fit your sitting room, so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry, and then if you have a green one you can have well I don't know. Um. Yeah. Maybe a ball. Know, a squashy ball. A relaxing squashy ball. That you can p well I see you're thinking, it's weird, you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit and I'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a um sticker sort of? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, like a Oh, okay, yeah. Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for Which is cheaper. Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually. Yeah. So it wouldn't be very big in either like how big? This big, and then you just do that, I suppose. Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy, like a a cover. But well the question is, which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that, and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that, and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is, and No. Um. That's nicer. I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater. Um. If it's a bit like those juggling balls, you can change shape according to your to the way you hold it. If it's got sand in it maybe, or something, you it it just moulds to your hand. We we don't know. Yeah. And the rest is the company the company colour's silver? Okay. Mm-hmm. Should also fit the batteries, which we haven't Okay. Mm-hmm. No but it does it automatically. Does it automatically? I don't know. Okay. Oh, a dynamo is ah, it's a bicycle. It's a bicycle mechanism. It's the en it's like if if something moves, when it moves, it stores energy. It's quite sweet. No. But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is, the moment you move it, it c it creates energy on its own. Which is quite cool. So if you throw it, it's gonna store loads of energy, and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying. But we need to find cost. Don't know the cost. Does anyone have costs on the on the web? Okay. Right. Mm. Oh, thank you. I it's strange because
Speaker D: 'Scuse me. Yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So. Oh, uh, there we go. Uh. Okay. Um. Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh. I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and and uh So so okay, let me get this right. Okay, uh Okay, alright anyway. Um here we go. Conceptual User Interface. Trying we're gonna try to talk about, um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control, based on fruit vegetable design. And, um, basically, so, this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system. Uh, so people are going to be looking at this little screen. Um, kind of I mean I assume, are we still on the screen idea? 'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um the wheel you it seems like you would need a screen. But like if you think about it yeah but if so is it just okay. So, b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that, aren't you? Are we Okay. Alright. Okay. Okay. Okay. So anyway if well we just we need to Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think I was thinking okay. So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? And you're just gonna I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a right. Yeah like you're g yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can okay we're not choosing that, I guess. But like choose channel control, like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like, um, you know, channels one two three four five six seven eight nine. So that people seems to be well You know. But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels. So um I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just I guess I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on. You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or I oh yeah? 'Cause you'll have to like but you can quickly s you can Yeah. Yeah if you do, it w so it would have to be you I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of, you know, range we need to have on the wheel, and um So you're either you're you know, th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that, you know, you can like tap for, um, different uh, whatchamacallits, different um, you know, functions like volume or, like you can tap just to get to different channels. Like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth And then there's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television, or if you want to um you know switch around, I don't know, like, these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that, like I would think so too, like So I mean and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it, you know, because but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen's sort of just like an option that, like, is just there and you're not really using it, that's kind of m yeah. Yeah, that's the only thing though. Yeah. So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing, um You can get to you know, you can Like maybe it'll be that central button that, like, then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ and you can just scroll around, like, to do the timer, to do the yeah, yeah. Yeah. But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up. Hmm? Yeah, well we don't want the screen I guess, but um 'cause that just it does seem like, it that would be, like, incredibly expensive, but I dunno, and then so, it just im really all you need is, like, this little wheel then, and you can control everything. So Yeah. It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_. Yeah. Yeah definitely. Like, I think we're looking at something that could be, like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing. I mean it it needs to be easy to somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your I mean how do how do I'm not really Like when I use an iPod, I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it. So Yeah. Or your thumb or something. So Yeah. Yeah, so Mm yeah. Yeah, so but I mean I think it could be pretty small. Like, I d I mean, you you want it to be large enough that you can But can't you just get K Yeah, But, I mean, do you need that? If if you can get to, you know if so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen. That keeps it really Yeah. Uh you wouldn't I don't I just don't think you would even need it. So Mean I mean you can do it, you it's it doesn't seem that hard. I mean I've never bought a remote. It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television, which is a little My I've never bought just a remote, like, so I don't I don't really know. But um So, um but I mean it's I've never had a hard time with like my remotes, like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever, you know. And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard. Yeah. Yeah. Well so So, do we need I dunno. Well I guess we have to you know think about But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up. That's what it does anyway. Yeah. Yeah. So, but oh, you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen? On the telly, okay, yeah. So yeah I think, I mean, I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like okay now I hit this you know, you have your little guide out and you're like, hit this button twice, like to activate the date. Yeah. I guess. And it is trendy, the iPods are really hot right now, so Um, yeah, by web research, yeah, so Oh. Yeah. Oh, okay, that would be cool. Mm. Yeah, c that's e that would be kind of oh, you know, usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type, you know, thing. But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda so you're like Or what if we integrated the the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables we somehow made it tactilely fash you know, we c tapped into that, so like it feels like a vegetable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You could name it after fruits and vegetables, or Yeah. So I think yeah, colours. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables. I do I dunno. Um That's in the shape of a fruit, like a Yeah. Oh I like that shape. Yeah. Yeah. It's like it has to be s yeah. Yeah. What if, yeah, what if the squishy, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, and you can so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thing and you could get you could have your choice, you know? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I think uh and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part. Yeah. So where are the fruit and vegetables now? Fruits and veg. Yeah. Yeah. We could promote the banana one. Like mm. Mm. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think, um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit. The part that you, yeah, can change into the different, you know, trendy vegetables and fruits. But uh it Yeah. Yeah. The dynamo would be interesting. Oh. Hmm. Hmm. Cool.","The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer gave her presentation on components and discussed which would have to be custom-made and which were standard. She also discussed the various materials and chips available. The Marketing Expert presented current trends in the market and in fashion. She discussed the current fruits and vegetables trend and the trend toward softer, spongier materials. The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the remote with the group. They discussed including a touch-based graphical user interface but noted that it was unnecessary and costly. They discussed using the menu function on the television instead. The group discussed how the menu function would be programmed. The group then talked about the casing of the device, and decided that there would be a changeable outer casing. They discussed including fruit colors in addition to the company colors. Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material. The group also discussed energy source options and chips. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype and the Marketing Expert to work on the prototype evaluation."
49,"Speaker A: All set? Okay. Cool. Right. So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control. And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion. So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only. So no we're not doing D_V_D_, we're not doing anything else, it's just gonna be a television remote. Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it. Um so that's red and black. And it has to have the slogan, case you guys forget the slogan it's, we put fashion in electronics. Um and no teletext. I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do, so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design. For reasons that I don't really know. There's but it's the board so there you go. So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote. Anyway. So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on Oh, right yeah. Yep. Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up. Yep. Cool. Brilliant. 'Kay. Mm. 'Kay. Fair enough. 'Kay. Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers, or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice, you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with? Okay, okay. Great. Thank you very much Nathan. Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well. S plug yourself in here. Mm. Um hit function F_ eight real quickly, hold down Mm. There you go. Sweet. Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before. Oh yeah look at that. Mm-hmm. Nice. Okay. Great. Thanks for that Ron. 'Kay yep that's you. Give it a little bit. That's great. Thank you Sarah. Right. So um yep I'll just uh switch that back here. I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase. Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic. Um Sarah, she's recommended that we go for simpler functions, so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to, you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted, thought about voice control, um so do we wanna go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic, and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um. Yes. So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic. Um. So uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well, we've got this idea, Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um, which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly. Um so um. How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable, um at least for the basic controls, maybe we can balance it that way, you know we can see. Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say um volume up. Mm. Right. The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find. 'Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away If it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button, maybe that could be voice activated too. Yeah. Or an isolated magnet or something like, or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing but yeah I like that, I like that, the voice recognition for the paging system. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Absolutely. Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know, that's perfectly viable question. Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group, aim it at them, but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control. Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many, we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well, we don't have many um. I appear to have lost my microphone. Mm. Right um we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool. Um right. I guess we've c we've touched on most of this. The idea of a paging function, a touch screen, and face plates. Um. The thing with I see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen? Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm. Okay. Okay. Right. Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it, we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth, um. True, if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important. Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing, n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations? Yeah yeah okay. Um Yeah I think that would be best. Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost, try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea. With a touch screen for the basic functions. Um And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen. Um do we have Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls. Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost. Mm-hmm. But then again that costs as well. Hmm. Do they? Okay. Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology. Okay so let's go with a um touch screen with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into, if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple you know so you know. Well yeah I mean you can put the we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know, you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics. Okay so we'll touch screen and the battery, focus on um uh presentation. Um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off, channels, volume, um and um a small paging function. Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging. Just a beep. Um right so any comments? Thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this. W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control. Yeah I think perhaps good idea but yeah I think that that one m might just be um and they just yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular a P_D_A_ would they would makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but I dunno, what do you guys think? Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there. Jus But apparently not. So. Yeah. Well fair enough. Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on. But then again who wants to turn on a remote control. Kind of if i Oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode. Okay. Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen, nice. Um. Um cool so any last things before we break? Alright. Fair enough. Sounds good. I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders. I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference. Brilliant. That's fab guys. Cool.
Speaker B: Okay. Gotta plug you in. Very nice. For your first PowerPoint it's lovely. Fine. It needs, yeah. Cool. Looks like you're in okay. There you go. Right. Does that mean I'm up? I think so. Okay. Oh that would be perfect. Thank you. Slide show up and running. Or not. Uh. Oh there we go. Perfect. Okay. So this is me. Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices. Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time, everybody's used to using changing the channel, turning it on, using the volume, m the majority of the time that's all that's going on, the other functions happen, for some people they're important, but the primary uses are really really basic. Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use, they're not using a lot of it, they don't need it, they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with. And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people, their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it. And then they can't find it in the room. So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something, will really come into play with a lot of these people. Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes, and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful, and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options. I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically, that's up to the design people, but it is s something worth thinking about, especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing, so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about. Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice, which are the standards. So it's a good start for us. Need to unplug this? Need it back. There you go. Oh right. We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so. Right. Right. Uh. Right. Yeah. Oh. That could work. I like that. Yeah. Something very basic. Right. Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then? Okay. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. K Yeah. True. Making it just an option? Yeah. Right. Are we still thinking about this screen sorry. Go ahead. The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing, it would be still, do we know if that's an option technically right now to that? Okay. Okay. We're doing okay. 'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions, you can have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition, settings, things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for. True. Worth looking into. Yeah. True. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Just the casing. Mm. Yeah. Right. Mm. Right. Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around, it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home, so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_ True. True. True. Yeah. Oh yeah. True. 'Cause it would have a docking base? Yeah. Can we afford that? And will somebody buy it if we don't? Right. For twelve Euros? It is. Fair enough. The basics. Mm. 'Kay. Mm. And oh. Yeah the the fashion do. Yeah. Right, and then you're dealing with ports and cords and Yeah. For now. Yeah. Nice. Um. Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away, perhaps it could be like a temporary Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think. Yeah. Y Yeah you would think. But. If it comes from above. Yeah. Mm. We're good? Yeah.
Speaker C: Th Well so. Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation. Um so a few of the requirements we need here. Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device, it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem. Um so some of my findings. Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set. Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television, uh switch to the next channel, that sort of thing, I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does. Um now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it. As you also notice it's quite a boring design. Um. Another remote control, slightly different, it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions, um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use. Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring. So my personal preferences. Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control. Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with. And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there. Um. Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh. I can plug you in. Sounds good. A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television. And you just say something to into that and it finds your The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control. So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market. And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not. 'S definitely an option technically. I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not, they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point. Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct, I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable. We could have the casing, the the face plates. Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room. Uh. Sure. Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um Interface? So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen? Those new ones. Be interesting. We put fashion into electronics. Yeah. Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that, I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device. I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on. Mm-hmm. Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on. Yep. Goes into a sleep mode. I've put my files in the shared folder as well.
Speaker D: Okay. So do I unplug this bit here? Okay. Right. That's page one of my presentation. So the uh method. We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project. Um remote control works as follows. This is all pretty basic stuff you guys. Um sends message to another system, so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power, something along those lines, there's an integrated circuit, which is the microchip, um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system. A user interface controls the chip, basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well. So my findings, um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands. And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals. Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like, and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer, just think of those lawsuits, that'd be really bad. Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction. Um, components. Just some ideas that I had, um, energy source, it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup. Um the user interface, I was since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic. The chip, um, silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that, we can't really be different in that respect. Um, the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard, multi channel, that's a word I made up, I don't really know what it means. Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range. Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices. Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s. Um personal preferences, I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal, um, the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value, 'cause we were thinking Right. Yeah that shouldn't be a problem. Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do. That's the end of my presentation. Is it plugged in well? There it goes. Computer adjusting. Mm. Mm. Right. I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology. With a simple command like locate. And then it could start to beep and therefore be found. Oh yeah I think that's very doable. Mm. It's a good point. Yeah. Mm. I was thinking uh Oh go ahead. Yeah. Gotta wonder though, if we're adding so much technology to this one remote, are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things. It seems like, we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip. The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism. So it's just something to consider. Back to the uh the cost the material. We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package? That's something I w for say we're including three or four face plates, it's gonna drive the cost up. And the other question is, if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market? We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether See if there if there's even interest out there. Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere. Yeah. Can we afford to include one of those? Right. Okay. Since we're doing uh touch screen, do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody. What what would be on that touch screen? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um logo or something or motto, I can't remember exactly what you said. 'S too much. Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen. That'd be okay. Mm. True. People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on. They just want it to be on and ready to go.","The Project Manager went over new requirements for the project: that the device was solely to control television, and that there would not be a teletext component. The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic components of a remote control device, and advised the group to use plastic for the casing material instead of metal. The User Interface Designer presented the technical functions of remote controls and compared the interfaces of two existing remote control products. The Marketing Expert made a presentation of the needs and the desires of the consumer and emphasized simplicity as one of the most desired features. The group discussed in more detail the features that will be added to the device: the possible applications of voice recognition, the touch screen menu interface, faceplates, and the look of the company logo."
21,"Speaker A: Yeah, I've got one too. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. There's usually a little thing in the top right for the Oh hang on, it's just coming on. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um I'm not sure. I had I've had some market information, but not from the company, no. Okay. 'Kay. I'm gonna pull this off. Uh-huh. Okay. I'll give it another go. Yeah, there we go. Right, we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control. And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ and um how do people use it? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them. Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them, and what improvements would would they like to remote control. And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers. And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control, the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings, um they weren't used very often at all. People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons. Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control. And young people were quite receptive to this, but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older, people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition. There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well. Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it. And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control, it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions, and to find your way around it. Okay, so My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech A design which looks high-tech, basically. Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market, and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power, and also volume and that sort of thing, as as Louisa said. Um we could maybe come up with a menu, a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control. That's worth thinking about. Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well, because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design. That that might be the market that we're we're looking for. And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room, rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels. 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise, so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel. Okay um, and that's the end of the slide show. That's it. Cool. Um about speech recognition? Yeah. Youn young people pref Yeah, they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups, people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to, so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well, which which again would probably be a bit expensive, but Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control? Considering Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So About five minutes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yep. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So do we need to decide on the functions now? S Mm-hmm. Yeah and Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said, so. I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that, so. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No not everyone can whistle, can they, though? No, clapping, I think clapping, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Taking out teletext, okay. Mm. I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number, so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in, but that again is probably an expense that Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I s I suppose um if people are buying remotes, then they're probably buying it to replace another remote 'cause all most tellies come with remotes, so. I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions, so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in. Yeah, that would be a good idea, yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Uh I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one. So maybe next to each of the buttons, you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it, so you're basically pressing Right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So th the The detailed ones would be sort of brightness, uh sorta Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And probably a power one as well. Dunno. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick, so. Um. Numbers is ten, volume is twelve, th Yeah si One up, one down. And a mute, yeah. That's sixteen isn't it, yeah. I don't think so, no. You've got brightness and contrast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know, saying that you want that particular thing tuned in. So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Okay.
Speaker B: We have a I guess we have a presentation each, 'cause I've got one. Um. Mm-hmm. Uh we didn't, no. I d I didn't personally. Okay that's fine. I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one. I'm not quite sure how it Control Doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment. Alt function F_ eight. Again not doing anything. Oh. pressed about five times now. Okay, that's me. Okay, um I have to go again. Hopefully that should be it this time. Okay, I think we're there. That's good. Okay, um Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design. Um of the of the remote control. Um I've just got three sections, first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um. And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote. Um so having researched the existing models within the market, um I found my research off the internet. Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function, actually are. And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television. Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply. Whether that'll be sort of two batteries, four batteries, um it may vary. We then have the user interface, which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote. Um the various functions used for changing channel, uh channel up and down, volume, things like that. Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things. And then the sender, which um is usually, I've found, an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television. Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself, because that's obviously found in the television.. Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working, so. I'll just go through there. S um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with, or? Oh I'll j Oh I see. Oh okay. I'll get rid of the bear Okay that's great. Okay, so we start off with a um battery suppl Uh no, a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery. Um we then have a particular button, which may be that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons. Um but this is how the basic system works. Um that sends after you press that that sends the message to the chip, which um then sends It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender. Um. So that's. That's the remote in itself, that's the components of the remote and how they work together. So this is the uh user interface. Um this is the chip itself, which then, and that's the that's the infra-red sender. And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver. And the sender sends a message to the receiver. 'Kay. Ah yes, that's the power source. Um. going on to personal preferences, I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote, just because of the size. You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote. Um and then the sender, and infra-red um has been used quite successfully. If the battery's on reasonable power, they always seem to work fairly well. You don't have to be point directly at the television itself. Um Yes. 'Kay and that's it for the moment. Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here, the the sort of circular section, because that seems to be for a video as well. So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume. Possibly? J yeah yeah yeah j yeah just this little bit is that I think that's still um a video remote part, so maybe we could get rid of that as well. It's just people are used to seeing that, so if we didn't have them then they might think it's Hmm. Okay, yeah. I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number. So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need. Um. So we could get it down to what? So we get to How many buttons have we got? We've just got ten, eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need. I guess. Um which isn't really too many. That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote. 'Kay. 'Kay. Ah yes yes, that seems good. I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up. I'm sure we'll have by the end of today. Mm. No what I maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition. Um. And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone, you lose that and you can ring it. Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two. So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else, wherever the remote actually is. That is true, yes. Hmm. So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote. Yeah. Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device. you could have an option to turn it off. Or Perhaps, um. So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels. Mm. 'Kay. Yes. Has to be simple enough to I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes. Um. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Yes. Um. Yes that seems right. Mm-hmm. Okay. Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment, and if something comes back I'd go more Yeah, f more for clap. Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together. Okay, ten numbers and then some kind of device to allow uh I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers. Or multiple digits. Did we decide anything about um the other functions? As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that? You had an had an idea about the menu? But just thinking um people probably I mean you don't have you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once, but you have to be able to tune it that once. So and if finally the T_V_ breaks, you get a new one, you're gonna have to be able to tune it. You can't really avoid that. Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves. So that'll be in Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. So how would this menu function work? Would you maybe have like one menu button, then you'd use the other buttons, maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions. Okay. we're gonna have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it, to guide Presu uh I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work. Right, okay um. that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two, and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it, so. That is that is a good idea actually. Sor sort of a second. Okay. Uh not quite, but I guess. Keep the other buttons but hide them away. So So um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well. So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists, I guess. So sh Should we decide in the next couple of minutes, and then So on the about the number. Um the volume up and down. Shall we have a mute button as well? A mute button as well. Yeah. Or But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one. 'Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change. We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by. I think you probably should. Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons? Okay, so we'll have um So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there? Is there anything else? Um. Maybe if we're gonna run out of time, one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be. So tuner up and down, I guess. Um up Tune one way, tune the o I I dunno I dunno possibly. Oh yeah and th and a enter button just to select. Yeah, okay. Um I guess we're keeping s it simple. We don't really need any other audio funct uh functions because it's just volume up, volume down. Um. Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products, then, or do you have to do it via the remote? Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple. Oh, okay. Right. Um. Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think Well shall we look into that and just get back together. 'Kay.
Speaker C: Yeah. No. What is it? I think you've got to do um control F_ eight. Shift F_ eight. Ah there, it's doing something. I think it's that little Right. Thank you. Mine's not quite as complicated as all that. Did I press function? Yeah. Oh. Um. Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design. I'm Louisa, the User Interface Designer, as you know. Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set, so that a desired function is performed. Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down, uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that. Um to change the channel, either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down. Um to switch the television on or off, maybe a standby button. Um here are two example remotes. Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward, rewind functions, so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about. Uh but as you can see, the left remote is quite um quite busy looking, quite complicated. Um whereas the right remote is much simpler, it looks much more user friendly. Um so my personal preference would be the right remote. So, it's got nice big buttons, it's got a very limited number of buttons. Um they're nice, kinda clearly labelled. Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that. So it's very very user friendly, and it's got a little splash of colour. Could maybe do with some more colour. Um. Hmm. Do we get to see that? Will you be presenting that in a bit? Hmm. What do you mean by the circular section? Like all of that bottom bit? Yeah. Yeah. And I don't really think that you need nine numbers. I mean how often do you use seven, eight and nine? I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough. Like how often do you hit nine? Hmm. Um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six, um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five. Hmm. Mm. Um. But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff, that would be tuned to one channel, and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels. Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers Yeah. But I suppose nine's not really excessive. I suppose it does make a good pattern. Okay. Um I think that's just for a video, so we wouldn't need any of that at all. Mm-hmm. Okay, so is everyone happy with that? Right well that's the end of my presentation. Do a lot of um There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at, I can't remember, and then they whistle back, or something like that. That'd probably be really simple, they're cheap. Yeah. Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function. 'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it. Yeah. I don't really know about the voice recognition thing. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either, 'cause everyone can whistle or clap, and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology. 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button, haven't we? Is that one of the Hmm. Right. Yeah, I think so, so zero to nine. Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, like the volume or something. Yeah, 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well. My dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark, so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up. Well, if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well, have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down, so there's kind of um everything else revealed? So you don't use it that much, you don't have to see it all the time. But it's all there if you need it. Like a hidden panel. Hmm. And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause, well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu, but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly. Yeah. And the volume? Um. Yeah. Yeah I think they're handy. I know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here, but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity. Have you seen the adverts? Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste. If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time. Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby. Yeah, it's maybe too much of a big issue for here. Uh-oh danger sign. Yeah, but a little bit smaller. Compromise. Right. On mute. so. And then Mm-hmm. Uh there's audio functions. Yeah. I think they normally do. Yeah. So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio, surround sort of things. Um maybe for the younger market. Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel. Oh no, I mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them, like on the T_V_ remote. But I don't really know what they're for, I've never used them. I just know they're something to do with Dolby. Right.
Speaker D: Right uh. So um. So where's the PowerPoint presentation? Sorry? Microsoft PowerPoint, right. Right, okay. So. Right. Okay, so we've got uh so we've got new project requirements. Um. So basically we've got three things, and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options. Um. Three presentations. I see, right. That's nice to know, one from each of you. Um new project requirements. Um so do we want to do the presentation first, or do we want to um W I I got um or or three things basically, um relating to the remote being only for T_V_. We discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway. So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled in a sense. Um we've got uh teletext outdated. Um did you get any information on that? Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing. So I I got that in email form. Um. Right okay. So I guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations. So we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh Sorry, yep. Oh. it going? Okay. Uh there's the rubber on the right, I think. it's magic. So the the top bit's the power source, yes?. So the battery is the in the sender. Okay. So, now more design. That's what we like to hear. Is it control function ei Oh, th there you go. Well there's a couple of things there. Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme. So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product. I haven't as yet, no. But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan. So uh I'm guessing that uh uh I notice on the bottom there it's got uh what's that? A_P_O_G_E_E_ that might be the corporate colour scheme, although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red. Well b uh w Well th the on the Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time, and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels. But but But, well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place, certainly the button up and down, but uh I mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for? I would have thought that uh it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard, you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others. So I would've thought that we wouldn't, you know, rather Okay, if the time of flicking from one to other, but presumably it'll take a second 'cause you have to be able to stop it. Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise. Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred, you could go one to one to ten, ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time. Anyway. Whatever. Okay. Okay. Limit the number of buttons, user friendly. Yeah. Well that's true, yeah, you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever, that that makes sense. Yeah. Does. So w so what was the circular thing that you were If it's just for T_V_, which is what it is at the moment. Mm-hmm. Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations. I'm I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing, or was I meant to give you that information? Right. Right, okay, so basically time to market seems to be important, therefore speed of delivery. We've only got about another four hours left. Yeah, I think she said twenty seconds to um What was that last wee bit there? Speech recognition, right okay. But that was only for young people that preferred it, older people didn't. Well that's right. Sounds reasonable. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing, you know without sound recognition. But if you I know. Um I was gonna say a sharp noise, you know a clapping of hand or whatever. You'd want to try and av just have the one product that if Yeah. Um I dunno um talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command, a set command whatever that happened to be. But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then Mm. So uh Any sugges Well, any conclusions? Well if it does then we can't. It's that simple, because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had The design logo was one, which we've already mentioned. We've got um the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly. And the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned, um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet. So that means that uh so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project. So we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out. So anything that uh is to be added, such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical. S It would. But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras. Added extras would be nice, but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window, which effectively now is sort of four hours. So and if and we've gotta get to the end. Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible. Okay. Right okay, uh so I need to Right. So I don't know how long we have left of our uh time. But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is. We'll also know w when the next meeting is I um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task. And then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes, we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this, this is how far we've progressed. Does that make reasonable sense? So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing. And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting, if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process, then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting. Do it via the email so that rather than coming you know If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine. Come along with it in the next meeting, we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate. But if you get it well before the next meeting, let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their uh on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting. Okay. Right, is there I would guess so. Yep. I w well uh i Something simple. Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time, time's short, you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product, something that's quick and simple. So, sounds good. Well, so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do, now something that doesn't like whis uh Well I I I don't know. Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine, then go for that option, but if I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle, so uh so clap option. Okay. Uh. Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying, that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext, so so take out teletext. Yeah. No. But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic and if it is at the moment, that's fine. But at the moment it's not, so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters, 'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable, or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is And it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale, so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech. Possibly. That's right. Okay, well. Mm. So y Ah That's a very good idea. So you keep um Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting, so I've been told. I don't know if you've got the same. Okay. So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back. Ah. Mm-hmm. That's right. data functions hidden at back. Can bring out when needed. That's right so we're dis So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back. We have to decide. I guess so. So on front, numbers, volume. Sorry? Mm. Mm-hmm. So so are you having the stand-by on the front, then? Well. Channel up and down. What else have we got? What was that, sixteen? Volume button. How many volumes? Right okay. Power button, stand-by, channel, up and down. So is that it? Okay. That's sixteen buttons, you reckon. And then at the back? Okay. So on the back it'll have brightness, contrast, anything else? You're also gonna have the channel tuner, as it were. Tuner, would that have up and down?. okay. Okay. Um up volume, yeah, I would have thought so. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well you might get some research. Okay. Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting. And we'll meet back at I'm not sure. Um forty minutes, I believe is the time. Come on.","so we've got new project requirements . So basically we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options . W I I got um or or three things basically , um relating to the remote being only for T_V_ . We discussed that last time Um we've got uh teletext outdated . Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing . So I I got that in email form . Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design . Um I've just got three sections , Um the basic components are an energy source We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . And then the sender , which um is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system because that's obviously found in the television . Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working , a power supply we then have a particular button , that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons . after you press that that sends the message to the chip , and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . that's the components of the remote So this is the uh user interface . And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver . which then , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . and infra-red um has been used quite successfully . Um and then the sender , Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . Um here are two example remotes . Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . Um whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . Um so my personal preference would be the right remote . it's got a very limited number of buttons . So , it's got nice big buttons , Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . So it's very very user friendly , But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , So we could dispense with that little bit as well because that seems to be for a video as well . and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . And I don't really think that you need nine numbers . Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others . Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels Um some remotes have kind of favourite options Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . Limit the number of buttons , But I suppose nine's not really excessive . you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , How many buttons have we got ? We've just got ten , eleven twelve th Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations . we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . and um how do people use it ? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all . People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . And young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said . Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels . 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . What was that last wee bit there ? Um about speech recognition ? But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't . and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . Um . And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at , and then they whistle back , or something like that . That'd probably be really simple , Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote . I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way Um I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever . a set command whatever that happened to be . and you can give it a command , because it'll recognise the voice you could have an option to turn it off . Or So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? Well if it does then we can't . and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical . S But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras . Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible . But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting . If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function . I don't really know about the voice recognition thing . clapping , I think clapping , 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ? Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers . Uh we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once , So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech . I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . Yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ? So you don't use it that much , That is that is a good idea actually . So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back . And that'll be better for the older generation as well So um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . The detailed ones would be sort of brightness , So on front , about the number . Um the volume up and down . A mute button as well . And probably a power one as well . I know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity . Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby . Yeah , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here . But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one . So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ? Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? Numbers is ten , volume is twelve , And a mute , yeah . And then at the back ? You've got brightness and contrast . Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . Uh there's audio functions . You're also gonna have the channel tuner , as it were . And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things . Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting . Well shall we look into that and just get back together ."
81,"Speaker A: It's Play-Doh. Because kids yeah. But um, it's it's made edible 'cause, yeah. It's made edible 'cause kids eat it, and if it's wasn't edible then Well, normal babies. Oh yeah it is, yeah. Oh yeah. That is cool. What's the big blue thing? Oh cool. And mute. Oh it's so cute. Yeah, but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family, what, they have two remotes? Yeah, I'm sure they'll be able to I mean it's only pressing buttons, you don't have to do anything, you know, extraordinary. I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so Yeah, it's not Yeah. Have them in stock. Make 'em more appealing as well.. And all the playing around is uh Yeah, I'm just do you wanna plug in? Okay. Mm. Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like, oops, it's gone. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, they'll buy more of them if you eat them,. Yeah. Yeah. It's better for And special material. Well they're rubber, aren't they? We're under budget. It's already saved, I think. Thank you. Mm. Oh, yeah. This is where we all get to I get to write on the, oops, on the board. Right. Oh. 'S function Okay. Mm. Okay. So, evaluation. We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria. I've got the criterias. And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true, so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria, and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria. And the criterias are, and I'll draw this up on the board so we have a box. And this is false, this is just like to keep you informed. So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle. So the first criteria. Do you all get what we're doing? Okay, cool. Okay, first criteria, look and feel. So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about? As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy? So what mark should we give for that? As in it's not. A one a one. So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one. Second criteria, new technology. Have we implemented new technology? As in the new high-tech So it's. So we'll give it a Yeah. I'd say it's about a a twoish? Two. Three. three. So criteria three is is it easy to use? I think it's a one, I think. Two, so it's But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then? Yeah. Yeah, okay. 'Kay, criteria four is costs. 's great. Yeah. Like the amount of buttons, 'cause people like a lot le like So it's a one? Um criteria six. R_S_I_ is it good against? Yes. Very good. It's one. And criteria seven, which is the last one, does it get lost? Is it easy to get lost? No? But it is smallish. Mm. I think i it would, could be, could get lost. Mm. Yeah. I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say I mean, it's not a one, definitely. Yeah. The mobiles get lost all the time. But then you ring 'em and you find them. So Yeah. So, that's that. So that's the evaluation, so I'd say Yay. It's like like a number one. Um. Number one product. All done, thanks. We fitted all the criterias. Yeah. Yeah, so So that's that one. been cool. In four diff in in four meetings. Funny, all designer meetings could be this quick. They're using our ideas. Yeah. Just start summarising now. You can reply to the same message. See summary, there. If you just reply to that one. Was it was it fifty or five? Depends how much we sell. We finished an hour earlier. Mm. Mm. Definitely. Yeah. Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them. No. Yay. Yep. We haven't got the five minute left thing yet. Mm mm. In project. I love it. I love it. I think it's cool. Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool. Being watched. Um Wow. Mm. Logitech. Yeah. Meeting adjourned.
Speaker B: I used to eat it. Yep. We've got a cool prototype. Double curved. Which is ant anti-R_S_I_. Oh right, yeah. Yeah, I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse, and everybody is using right-handed mouse. Imagine d are you right handed? Imagine you're doing it with your left hand, I don't think it's too But we can have both uh Yeah. I think it does. Yeah. There you go. Play-Doh is very cheap. Chew proof. Oh ho-ho. Yep. Rubber. Yeah.. Mm-hmm. A one. Well, the kinetic thing, yeah. Well so the um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. True. Two. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yes s yeah. It's yellow. Two. T Mm. Mm. We've, we've done well. Well. You know It is. Y Oh really? Mm yep. Cool. Glad to hear that. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker C: Play-Doh's edible. Did you know that? It's definitely Yeah. It's it's chew proof. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Everybody everybody ready? Okay, let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation? Nice. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. what button? Um. Oh mute. Okay. That certainly does. Mm. Mm. Yeah. 'S great. I have one thing about it, but it's a small thing, but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one. But, that's I don't see why that's not possible. Yeah. They make left-handed scissors, you know. Yes s Mm. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. But um other than that, I mean uh and that's um, you know, that's just something, I think I think it's great, yeah, great idea. I think it's, well, if the R_R_ motto is, we bring fashion to to electronics, I'd say that could be quite fashionable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, very good, yeah. It's come up with what we've you know, the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing, hasn't it, all seems to be there. Well done. Um before we move on I need that cable. Thank you. Yeah. Um. One thing I do need to do we need to look at, is the costs. Well, yeah. um Yeah. Uh right. Okay, now I think we'll do this I could do you know, I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you, but it's just easy enough to go through it with you, so we're going for the kinetic power. And the electronics, we decided on it being just a simple, the easiest thing that's inside it. Ooh. So the case, we've gone for the double curved. Um and it's made out of rubber. The interface is push-buttons. And button supplements well they're in diff special colours, aren't they? So special colours. Special form, yeah, they're a special form there in shapes and stuff. Yep. Yeah. Um. Are they made out of any special material? No they're not. They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything, they're just simple Okay. Right. So let's see if that comes within budget. And it does. That is gonna cost uh Yeah. That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make. And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty. So, this is all very very good. The bosses will be very pleased. Okay, let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you. Uh. Save it in save it in the uh my documents. Splendid. Okay. So uh, that's done with this with this um doodah, so you're. Gonna do what you were gonna do, your evaluation. F_ eight. I love the smell of that Play-Doh. I cou. I would give it a seven. Oh sorry, one, d yeah. Yeah.. Yeah, but that's not a technological thing, that's another thing, i that's another marketing thing. So on the technical side of it it Easy to use. I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not. I would give it a I would give it a two, 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people, but Yeah. Give it a t give it a two. Cost. It's come in under budget. So that's a definite one. Amount of buttons. Contains only the necessary buttons. Yeah. So it's anti-R_S_I_. I don't think it's gonna get lost easily. two. I mean it No, I mean I mean, you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically, but Okay. Alright it's all all systems go. We can't fail.. Well done, Reissa. Okay, I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know, little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it, you know, both individually and as a team. You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments, um and then come together and worked in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, psp, you know, especially you two. That's all, you know, gone very very well and and and be you know, has been good communication going on. Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about? Fantastic. I think So I I, you know, and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before, we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design. Yeah. You know, maybe this isn't a simulation, maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just, yeah, they get Yeah. Yeah, two years' time this will be on the market. Ex exactly that product um thum we'll go, yeah, we designed that and no-one will believe us. But um No, I think when this meeting's finished like officially, there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in. Or six, uh I haven't got message. It gets handed over to another department. What our what our project was was to come up with the product, basically. the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget. When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and, you know, the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah, the all the guys in the profit sharing, yeah. Um. Yeah, that's it. You know, we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product, we've ma we've got the prototype, it's within budget, it's does everything that we wanted it to do. It's new, it's it's um something that uh that isn't out there already. Yeah. Well, this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that, it's that it's um, hang on, I wrote it down here somewhere Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off. Um that, you know, it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury, our one does the complete opposite, you know, so that's something that's new, which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new. Yeah, and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_, you can f throw it about, you know. It's fine, it's kid proof. Well, you can break the ornaments, but you won't break that. Yeah. So all in all, I think we've done very well. Well done everybody. Um. Drinks are on the company. In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to. Yeah. That's it. Well, as far as I t as far as I know. Um. No. Anyone wanna play I spy? Yeah, I guess. I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire. Um. It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before. But I'm not the authority to say that it is. Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that? Yeah. I thi you know, I'd I'd n yeah, as we said earlier, I've not never seen that before. something that t the whiteboard thingy, that's great. Um, but a p a pen with a camera on it, I don't think it's such a new thing. I mean it's i or in such a new idea. It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff, but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah.
Speaker D: I've, I've definitely eaten it before. I didn't know was edible.. Actually that makes sense, because I remember like, peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough. Mm-hmm. Yeah. We've got some. Yeah, it's pretty exciting. So, everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber, very simple and easy to use, yeah, double curved, um but also something that was gonna jump out at people, something that would be different uh, separate it from the other remotes out on the market. So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand, you'll see what a nice thing we have going here. So, basically, if you hold it like that, the one on your thumb, yeah, the thumb button is the power button. Your index finger is channel up, middle finger is channel down, ring finger is volume up, your pinkie is volume down. That's the lock button, has a L_ L_ on it and then the M_ is a mute button. And then it also has digit For muting the uh Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want. So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available, but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different. So all the, I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them. So you don't you Yeah. It should be. And it's also conformable to the size of your hand. I mean if that's too big, it's a rubber remote, so you can, you know change that. So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it Ah, that's good thinking, yeah. Yeah, if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes. Yeah, I didn't I didn't think about that, but I'd yeah,. Uh-huh. Yeah. Do you think it says R_R_? Fashion to electronics. Yeah. Yeah. And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue. Plus red, which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh. So that's that's our end of things wha uh That's Yeah. The costs, was that what you said? But it's edible. That was the main criteria from the last meeting, it had to be chew proof. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, these these ones on the side are curved kind of, so The buttons are rubber. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected. Yeah, have some have some. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Oh, sorry, one. Yeah. That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple, but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new. It's ergonomic, but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing, yeah. It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere, maybe, yeah, I dunno. Maybe three, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Okay. If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one, but otherwise otherwise a two. Yeah. That was great. Yeah. It is very bright, yeah. It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something, you know. Maybe it will. Uh. You think it could lost Mm. Okay. Yeah, anything, I mean. Okay. It's bigger than the average mobile, I guess. But, yeah, it can get lost. Yeah. Okay, yeah, two is fine. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion, but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and just just We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and Now you guys have been a a great team. Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams,. Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote. So at this stage, I mean, is this the last meeting of the project? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something? So there's no way to like predict what our 'Cause we had a we originally had a As far as our financial uh um goals, we had a specific number for profits that we wanted. It was fifty mil fifty million I don't remember. But there's not a way to compute that, I mean, since we saved on the on the production cost, do we know how much we're making on profit? Uh. Hmm. But we have a vested interest prof profit sharing. I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh, you know, after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote, you know. We're not we're not you know, tying tying our cart to that one horse. Mm. Mm. Mm. It make watching T_V_ healthy. Uh. Right, you too. Mm. That's it. I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence. Should we call the day then? Uh, right. Mm-hmm. Your moment to shine. Right, I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that, it's just the first step. I guess we should end this, since we're off off topic. So. Shall we Right.","The interface specialist and industrial designer presented their prototype to the team and discussed the features the prototype contained. In presenting the prototype, the issue arose that the prototype could only be used with the right hand. The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and found that their remote was actually under budget and that they could retain all the features they had originally decided upon without exceeding the target cost. The team evaluated the prototype on the basis of its look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, costs, and its ability to be misplaced. Overall, the prototype performed very well in meeting all the criteria of the evaluation. The team then evaluated the project process, finding that they were happy with their product and their performance in the project."
64,"Speaker A: Good morning. Well Well uh I'm uh and my uh function is User Interface Design, I think. So uh that's me. Me too. Oh. So we can't erase anything. Right. Alright. It's a sheep. A beaver. It's weird. It has wings? Well the snail doesn't have legs. Oh right. Well. It's a giraffe. Or a dinosaur. Yes. Giraffe. Should I uh Alright. So I can draw, but uh Uh. Well. Oh. Oh wrong one. Uh. Well uh you can guess what it is, I hope. It's a rabbit. And uh well uh it's uh quick, I guess. That's uh my uh favourite animal. A dolphin. Right. Well. With an E_. You can try out the eraser now. Not really. I always lose them. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. search for the buttons, which one is which and uh Well. Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls. Yes, perhaps you can integrate them or something. Yes. Your stereo and your T_V_ and uh. Perhaps that's an idea. Yeah, that's right. And which you don't use. Right. Yeah. You should just give it to. Changing channel. Yes. But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it. Because uh things for uh teletext, I dunno uh, w what's the name? Yeah. But But if if it's if it's international you should uh look in think in Britain they have uh different things they can do with the T_V_, or so uh that you can choose what you want to see. I dunno if you should uh take that in consideration, or that you just should aim for the normal T_V_s that uh And the B_B_C_. Yes. Yeah, I don't know if the they have that anywhere else, though. Yeah, we can leave that. Yeah. Well but but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search. That's not Yeah, that's right. Yeah that's uh. Well not everywhere. Yeah, you can choose the code. Yeah. But the people have a new television, and c if you look into the future, then they want will want the button, if their thing is broke. Yeah. Guess not. Yeah meeting will close in five minutes. Hmm hmm. No interface. No the Yeah. So So I should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote, or uh, or how I don't really Right. Alright. Me too. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Speaker B: Good morning. Sorry? Yeah, busy job. Good morning. So Oh, good morning everyone. I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting. I've prepared a little presentation. My name is and uh I hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes, as will I. Um I'm the Project Manager of this project, and uh, well I will tell you on what actually is the project. This is uh the agenda for our first meeting. Um this is the opening, then we will get I will hope we will get acquainted to each other. We'll do a little tool training with these two things. We'll take a look at the project plan. Uh there will be time for discussion. Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product. And then we will close this session. Um but first of all we I'd like to uh introduce you to this room. Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table. Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face. Um there are cameras everywhere around the room especially here for your face, of course, and this isn't a pie, it's a a set of microphones and there are microphones here also. But please uh don't be afraid of them. They won't hurt you. Um well uh I said I'm the Project Manager and uh I'm hoping uh for a good project and uh I'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project. Let's start with the ladies. Okay, so I. Okay, well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company. That's good. Um well I said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which uh has to be original, trendy and of course, user friendly. And uh I hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a product. Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods. It consists of three phases, namely the functional design, conceptual design and detailed design. As you can see, all of these phases consists of two parts, namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far. Okay. But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here. I already talked about the cameras and microphones, but they are not of uh much use to us. Uh we will have to take advantage of these two things. They are smart boards. As you can see, you can give a presentation on them. And uh this one here is a white board. I will uh instruct you about that soon. Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room. Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder. As you can see, this is the same tool bar uh as is located here. Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page, um uh to go back and forward between pages, and of course uh to save it every now and then. Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board, for instance like this if everything's okay, but I first have to put it on the pen, you see I'm new to it too. Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want. As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow, it's not such a fast board, it's a smart board but also a slow board. Uh but you can write things and of course you can also, when you click here, uh erase things, so we have uh est left. And um you can also delete an entire page, but we ask you not to do that. Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results. Um does everyone understand this nice application? Well you can erase it with the eraser, but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page, but just create a new blank one. I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet. But you can of course erase when you make a mistake, but don't uh delete entire pages. And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen, for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five. Um that's what you will need for our first exercise, because I'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal. It's also to gets to know each other because um I'm asking three things, uh for that uh drawing, to do it on a blank sheet, with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour, and also with different pen widths which I also showed you. Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word. Well I'm not very good at drawing, but I will uh go first and um try to draw Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing, eh. Well it uh could be everything. Maybe when I put on this thing it could be a turtle, or a snail, and But a turtle has. And those are slow. And I hope our project group will not be slow, but we will uh work to a good result and do it uh as fast as we can. Okay, time for another animal. Would you like to go next? Mm-hmm. Okay. Could you write the words, uh underneath it? Or more words. Little rabbits. Okay, thank you. And our final drawing. Mm-hmm. Okay, well thank you very much. I can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group, huh? Well, nice animals, nice words. Sounds good. Um back to business, back to the money part. Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros. And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market. And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max. Okay, well it's time uh for some discussion. I've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about. Uh what's your experience with remote controls, um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control, maybe for which market segments should we aim, or should we aim for all segments. Uh well actually I'd like to hand the word uh back to you. What's your experience with remote control? Mm-hmm. Boring, it's not fun to use a remote. Mm-hmm. Well maybe we should try to make it fun. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So maybe a a minimalist design, the least uh possible amount uh of buttons. Mm-hmm. So you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons, but on the other hand they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, well any more ideas? No? Okay, yeah well we have some time. Let's see what more I have to tell you. I don't think there is much left. Nope. We're starting to close. Um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little bit early, but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes. In the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions. Um, as you can see, the different roles have uh different tasks. And there's a ping. Is it my laptop? Yep. Ah well that's good, five minutes and uh the meeting's over, uh right on schedule. Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification. The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design. And this was the Interface Designer? Or the Interaction Designer. Or what was it, I_D_? Interface Designer, okay, first guess was right. Uh will take a look at the the working design. Industrial Designer, okay, sorry. Let's just use the acronyms. Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach. Uh well those instructions will be uh in the email you will receive uh shortly, I hope. And of course you have your own uh expertise. Well uh that was what I had to say. Uh are there any more questions? No? Okay well I think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working. Okay, one question? Okay we're still going. Okay, well I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly. Okay well uh see you all in about thirty minutes, then. Thank you very much.
Speaker C: My name's. I'm uh Marketing Expert. My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers. So I also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other. Mm-hmm. S Good. No. Dinos Dinosaur. Beaver. Turtle. No problem. No problem. Mm. It was four months? Nice, okay. To make it a little bit easier. No, it's a giraffe. 'Kay. I think it's easy to r uh to recognise as a giraffe. Yeah, the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck, it can reach everything. And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project. So that's my favourite animal. Anything else you need to know? Oh, uh Tall. So, 'kay. It's a mouse. A bunny rabbit. Uh-huh. No problem. Bob Ross. Dolphin. Yeah. Complex. No. No. Boring. No. Black, all black. So, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The the angle you have to use. You had different remote controls for different devices. Yes. Yeah. Yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons, so Flap yeah. Yeah, okay, that's possible, but it'll get very big the the remote control. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. numbers. On and off. Yeah, play, pause, stop. Mm-hmm, of course. No. Yeah. Because I think a market will be all kind of people. Elderly p el elderly, young people, so. Yeah I think that's the better one, because I think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain then I think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty, I think. I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain, yeah. Not that much. Mm. Standard deliver. Mm. No but Yeah. Yeah, th it it's I think that's not Yeah, okay. No. I think n m n most televisions nowadays do this. So I think numerals. Yeah, but then you have to choose the this always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code. You can use which which type of television you have. That's no problem. But I think like the two pages on the same screen, like teletext and normal television, that's that's nowadays standard, I think. Simplicity. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah g available. True. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Interface. Uh-huh. No. I have one question. Where does it says we have to make a remote, because I presumed She didn't know who. Okay, no, no problem. No problem. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Speaker D: Good morning. Okay, uh I'm uh I'm the Industrial Designer and I uh hope to uh look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Seal, a seal. A be Mm. With a tail and a mouth. Snail. Okay. Sure. The hell. Make that cute. Tall. B Bunny rabbit. Okay. Okay, um. Uh I uh draw I I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence. One of the most intelligent uh animals in our world. Yeah intelligent. I've I've uh Eraser. Pen. Well not perfect, but okay. A lot of buttons. And you always lose them. A lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use Complex. Not user friendly. Mm. Black colours. They use batteries and batteries uh and poor signal. Uh. Yeah, different remote controls, yeah. Uh for the use of different uh devices. Yeah but you could uh I thin uh there's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em. That's possible, so that you only get the No n n no, just Uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday, but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in Dutch. Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly. Or uh the numbers, of course. But uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television. You only use those uh the first time, or. So. Uh. Yeah, I think so, yeah. Yeah, uh teletext. think so. Okay. Right. Uh. Yeah I I understand. No. Yeah. When I think of it uh I think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh to make it user friendly. So uh I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control, they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television. So uh it only has to have uh the most used buttons. You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television. In those in that Yeah but I but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control. It's impossible. Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext, and on the other side uh just n uh regular television. Uh Yeah, but uh they don't use the same signal, uh on remote control. Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, but uh I think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because because uh the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken, so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television, so that option is not uh optional for those uh people. Yeah, yeah. So we should take that in consideration. Oh mm, no. Things'll come up. Stop the meeting now. Okay. Mm. No? No, the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design, and the in uh usability interaction Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. No. Okay. Oh. No problem. Okay. Alrighty. Okay.","I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting . Um I'm the Project Manager of this project , This is uh the agenda for our first meeting . I will hope we will get acquainted to each other .

Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . Uh Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television . always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . Um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes . In the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions . meeting will close in five minutes . Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification . The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design . the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design , Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach . I think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working . I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly . see you all in about thirty minutes , then . Where does it says we have to make a remote ,"
34,"Speaker A: Mm-hmm. Alright. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Alright. Alright. Easy to use? I think that's your ta Mm. You Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway, so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device. Alright. Uh you think? Mm. Mm. Alright. Yeah, among the old people, yeah. Right, I am going to tell you something about the components design. Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties. This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device. And the materials? Um I have heard several things, so I uh I'll have to change that on the way. But uh the case? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic. But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong. It should feel strong. So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient. We should move to uh something Well yeah. Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough, but it doesn't have a really really tough look. So Yeah. Also Yeah. Mm-hmm. But we'll return to that. Uh the buttons of course rubber, I think everyone agrees. And electrical cables, copper is all pretty basic stuff. The chips made of silicon, I guess. I think that's the best uh way to do it. And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb. Then I've uh had a few findings, made a few findings. Uh the target audience product style. Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like, as you said, uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that. They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style. But of course that's not our uh things this. So this is things we must not do. And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people, which is of course our uh group, the people we aim at. Um under forty five years old. Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours. Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said, that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking. But they like soft materials, uh so we might uh we have to consider that. And also they like curved round shapes. So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want. And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here, that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices, gaming devices, should define the characteristics of the device. But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device, so we don't really have to consider that. Mm. Well I also have um several examples of uh styles, so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean. Uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff. It was not very uh interesting uh, very classical looking, but that's n that's not what we want. We have these kind of things. I don't know what exactly they are. It looks like Well you know uh you recognise the shapes, it's very primary colours, uh bright colours and uh round shapes. You also uh see uh this device, it's not very round and Fruity of course. Yeah, it uh That's true. And uh well round shapes, primary colours. You can see it all here. And of course uh this famous device. I think as you know something uh some devices like this. So to give you an idea of uh This has a strong look. Although it's plastic, it's it's grey to to to give it iron look. That's uh Yeah. Well we have to make a Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control. I don't think that's very practical, but But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour. Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking, it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger. 'Cause if you look at this, it it doesn't look very very strong, becau But this is plastic, and and this too, but The feel? Uh alright. Well Mm-hmm. And I Then I have some more findings. Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device, uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery. I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course. But solar energy is not very practical inside a house, because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun. And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical, I think, for uh for a simple remote, that's a bit, oh, that's a bit uh That's a bit uh much. And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case. Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium. That that's the information I received. If you use the curved case, uh a curved case, double curved then you can't use titanium. Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look. And uh now the the shape, yeah, a curved case. Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something. Uh a more modern look not plain, long box style, but I'll draw it, but maybe later. And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape, than if you have uh. Um anyway Um f as uh for the buttons, simple push buttons. No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that, because it makes more complex and expensive. And, uh as we agreed, we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device. Because it makes it also more complex and expensive. But we do use an L_C_D_ screen, so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip, which is more complex and expensive. But It's worth the trouble I think, because Uh rubber is a soft material, I guess. Uh soft enough. So that's uh basically what I want to talk about. Oh, yeah, I understand. Yeah. Yeah. But it it's n nice for young people. They like gadgets. Yeah. If it's cheap. Yeah. Can you draw it now of uh Can you draw it now? Mm. Alright. button, yeah. I suggest a banana shape. Because of the fruity uh fashion. Yellow and Yeah alright, yeah. Just a hunch. Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course? And then below is the L_C_D_ screen? Alright, yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh by pe pressing the menu button again. By pressing the menu button again, you go uh out. It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. But you can men you can press menu again to get out. No. Why would you put it uh then, and where is the recording uh the microphone? Where would you put it? Uh-huh. Microphone, yeah. Yeah I understand. Uh but uh we could uh d do, but it's perhaps more expensive, uh the speaker on the back or something. Alright. Well yeah yeah yeah. I can live with it. They do they don't look fruity enough. Tho Yeah those But it doesn't uh the Yeah, ok Yeah. But it it must not look too childish of course huh? But it Yeah. Not not too strange. No. Exotic yeah. We have t Yeah, yeah. I will design it, we design it later. So we'll get to that later I guess. The specific shape. The Our sources. But uh we should decide now. So we have to uh put it in one uh document. Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document, and then uh put the answers after the subjects. Yeah. Well we have to decide all these things? W we can uh override them? Well a case? Uh that's me. Uh I suggest Well what do I suggest actually? Uh s solid, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. So we have titanium. Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote, so not the front, could be titanium, to give that uh strong look. And then the front is made of plastic. And you can put that on and off, and switch it. No but you have titanium of course. Uh you have the best of both worlds. And of course, yeah, you have the the the plastic front end. But you also have the titanium. Yeah of course, but yeah you have to make a decision. I guess so. Uh titanium I sh I think uh Huh? Well, well the According to my sources, uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available, and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it, if we want. Mm. Mm. Yeah, I think that's a nice trade-off. Alright. Yeah, for the front and then titanium for the back. For the non-removable uh part. Well but The titan titanium isn't isn't v very Yeah, i it doesn't uh curves. No uh I nei. Titanium is very No no no, but you know b Titanium is very basic colour, and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front. I dunno if if you disagree, but I think it's doesn't matter very much. And even if it does uh doesn't match, it will uh People like mm colours that don't match. Cop copper uh material. Excuse me? Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh Yeah in Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh Oh external? Well A coffee grind doesn't have Na ja. Never mind the coffee grind. Right? Alright. Mm-hmm. Yeah the the the front w Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. For the for the launch, yeah. So e th then a c couple of basic colours. Not not very uh sim Not Yeah. Yeah. Very boring, yeah. The most boring fronts possible. Yeah but you you can have some basic colours, and then we come with the special patterns on them, and and uh And uh Uh we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design. Because yeah we have the sketch but Alright, yeah. The price? We all agree on that. Yeah. Together or uh Yeah together. How Yeah yeah, but how do I Some Some non functional tasks. You're fired. No but Well, can we talk about something else? Uh Uh no I don't know anything, but maybe uh anyone else uh Yeah? Round I think. To make it as uh as round as possible. But now I see the Well th th th th th that depends uh. Well we uh We we j we'll just give them an uh We'll design it, and then they can give comments on it. Well yeah. Um I think um a logo, our company logo, and the slogan should be or could be Yeah, why not? If there's enough space, you can put uh We'll we'll Well, our slogan is not very long. It's just a simple What is it? You c But you can put it on the back, on the titanium part. The logo and the and the Yeah they do. Well yeah. Right corner, or maybe here in the middle? Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board, and you can remove the front. I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing. But am I the only one, or uh No not on the front, but on the backside. Uh I think it's a nice idea, to make it more recognisable, that the next to the logo you have the slogan. To make more uh of an impression. Not too big. No, very small. Not on the entire back, but uh just very small. But readable enough of course. But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design. Lo Uh yeah. Or maybe here in the middle, but we'll decide later. Do you do you see a bit of the of the um of the uh titanium? O on the front? Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium, the front is the the upper part, and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen. So Yeah. No no betwe of between we can do but But then you have two parts of front, two fronts that This enti entire bottom? And then the lower part is titanium? I think that's nice, yeah. Yeah. I like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone. Maybe you can show it. It also has the those two distinct uh Mm bit like this. Uh it's uh Yeah yeah. That uh Yeah. Maybe a nice touch, yeah. I think I'm going to buy it. That's a bit too much, but No, no no no, but I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually. Of course, because it's my design but No our d our design, alright. But don't erase my cat. I want to preserve it. What are you doing chief? Yeah until the until the beep goes. But I don't uh Do we have to stay here, or I think we have to return first. The high powers from above will have to tell us, yeah. Yeah, touch-pads, yeah. We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote. No just kidding. Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too, because it becomes too too too too stressy. But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality, so Yeah. Bless you. Mm. Too much? Well they uh I think that's good. We all had uh our talk and we agree I guess on uh several thing, on most uh on things. Yeah you have to push harder. Mm. Where's the good old chalk board with the the green board with the, how do you call it, chalk, yeah. Yeah, maybe. Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated, we can draw a thing quick, and then before it uh goes off again. Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here? Huh? Yeah. Guess so. A happy hol happy holidays.
Speaker B: Okay. Uh door is closed. Well, let's begin. Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting, we'll have to hurry up. Um well I'll start with the presentation again, the agenda. Yo. So. Uh This one I think. Uh yeah. Well alright. Um well, I'll show you the notes. It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting, but I'll show them. We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design. Um Then we'll have to dec decide about the control, the remote control concepts. I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder, which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take. So this time we exactly know what to decide about. And then we'll close again. Uh Well these are some examples, but we'll talk about them later. We'll first look at your uh presentations. Alright? Walter will uh start again this time? Yo. 'Kay. 'Kay. Less. Well, yeah. L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts. Well, easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh Functional is not an issue, and then easy to use. Well we have to choose one of them. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. We'll we'll look at uh. 'Kay. So Well Yeah, well Yeah. B Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year. Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different. Yes. Yep, alright. Wood is popular. Aha. Yeah yeah yeah. Alright. Nice, uh well show us. Well maybe it it it is, but it doesn't look strong. So maybe But we still have to look at our price of course. Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh Yeah? Yes. Sports uh, they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh Huh? That's nice. All the results? Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Nai. Uh no. It's t terrible. Alright. Hmm? Yeah, alright. Yeah. And it's round. Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour. So uh those kind of things you can you can combine. No, it isn't. Okay. Yes. So, if you ti Well You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something. So it it looks pretty but it feels strong. No titanium. What do you exactly mean with double curved? Double curved? It it mean Yeah, well okay. Well This soft material thing from uh Yeah. Alright. Okay. We will take that. And then uh Mike? Okay. Oh That's interesting. Okay. But you can also say that, when you say something, it does some function. Oh. That's a bit uh Yes. I understand. But it has no functionality for our remote at all. Hmm. So you put a menu in the L_C_D_? Ah. But then we should also have an uh an Okay button. Just uh There is already a blank. Yes? So Yeah. No m Next year that's out. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. And what's the menu button? But how did How do you get out of the menu then? Yeah. Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay. Uh Yes, well but bec because when you push Menu you get in, and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice. And Well that's also the Okay button. That's you you should have uh Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out. Exit. Well, it's just a choice. Huh? Yeah? Okay. Well, okay, alright. Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make. I'd I agree. Fine. Yeah. Yes? Too big. They're all black. Hey, that one I like. No. The remote. Terrible. It's it's all too much buttons. Too many buttons. That's Well, that's too expensive I think. Alright. Yeah. Okay. Huh. Mm no. 'Kay. No, not very strange. It still has t Yes. Th a a kind of bridge. So it f falls over the hand. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. Well I have at home a remote with a bridge. It's just a half round half half circle at And then it falls exactly over the hand, and that's very nice. That's It feels comfortable. Yeah. Yeah, alright. Um where did I put it? Um conceptual phase, I think this is it. I got this from our friends. So Uh yeah the conceptual design. These are a few examples which we have to decide about. All the the materials from the case, uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story. Um Yeah. Um now from the user interface, your uh package? Um where No well, that's more like the buttons where they have to come. And um B a bit of, yeah well, a bit of uh design. Yes, but we have to decide about these now. And uh the trend-watching. So as you said, fruity is in, well sells good. Wow. Uh these things. Uh yes. Um so if we uh go through them Yeah well uh Why should I uh Yeah. So What what kind of properties should it have? Well we just listened. You know what? Alright. I've uh Titanium back, plastic front. Okay. Um well I am going to put it in here, uh because we can uh look. I Um solid feel and trendy look. So material, um hard plastic for the front? Okay. And well the the electrical cable is just normal uh. It's uh from uh our coffee uh Of course. Well uh all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work. So The chip is normal silicon. Uh the buttons are normal, etcetera. Okay? So that's just easy. Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes. The conceptual specification of the user interface? Um well we have our beautiful drawing. Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder, and then I'll put it in our end report. Yes, you can Mm yeah. You can uh put some uh which button is what. Okay. Um the trend-watching included these days. And what do we? We thing that fruit and bright colours are Yes. We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot. Uh those kind of things. Yeah. Launch different lines at once. We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time. Yeah. Come on. We still have to make those fifty million, yeah?. The most ugly. Two. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Um well the buttons etcetera, we get from Mike. Uh this fruit and bright colours, yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour, we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch, when we uh well introduce our remote. Yes. Yes. Well I'll have to, before I get another warning for five minutes, I'm going to get Where is my mouse? Uh where is my mouse? Oh yeah. Um this is it. Well, um this we have. Uh basic stuff. Interface we have. Supplements, L_C_D_. Maybe a a cheap voice recording. Well Yes. Alright. Individual actions. Industry designer,. User Interface, Mike. You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard. That's what I got uh to hear. Yes well we'll get it to hear that I think. But I think so. Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it This is the SMARTboard, so Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype, and y Well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera. Yeah. So you'll get it on your em on your laptop. Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project yeah project evaluation. So um, what are you going to do? Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means, but uh you'll get uh the specifications. Yeah. That's why I uh But uh How long do we still have? Yeah. Why does Ah f fuck you. Heh? We can't get Ts It doesn't work any more. We can't save them. So we'll just have them uh standing there. No. It's a bit uh bit a pity. Well we still have uh more than five minutes. Um So what are we going to do? I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue. Oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote. Also the slogan? On the We put the fashion in electronics. We put the fashion in electronics. On the top. Yeah. Well in in in the right top corner? And well you c On the back, you can put uh h At the bottom, you can put the logo with the Yeah. Just just small. Yeah well Carved into the material. No, you you can carve it into the titanium at the back. Well, management would like it. The front side, no no l no slogan. Sorry. Yes, slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front but not exchange uh Uh? Hmm? Uh when changing fronts. Alright, that's decided. Five minutes left. So a bit of titanium between? That's a bit Oh that that's that's pretty cool. No? Yes. I already have uh all kinds of uh filth between the mobile. Yeah. Round forms. Yep. Yeah. What? So round where? Oh, yeah. Yes, that also sounds uh pretty uh neat. We want it. And it's only f twenty five Euros. Come on. No that's nothing. The Phillips remote uh costs more. Well uh you two are going to work together. You'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop, and then uh you uh Well I think we can, I just It's Yeah, o Oh Oh, we have a one. So, you can uh draw a Yeah. Well I'll get a I'll get the message. No, I think uh Well you'll Maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here. Or get your mouse. Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates. I always have a mouse next to my laptop. I hate these Ugh. And in your remote control. So we put a touch pad on it, and say ha ha. Yeah. We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but But they do want some gadgets. So that's wha what we're doing. Well we won't. Our bosses will be rich. Well, that's not bad, is it? Mm. So Oh. Oh he's totally off again. Well But when I start here, it's here. So is it Nope. Yeah. Let's go. Finish the meeting now. Alright now we know what to do, so Um Message? No, get away. Um I I'm not sure. Maybe you Yeah. Well you'll have to work on this one. Yeah. That's a good idea. Well Good luck.
Speaker C: Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use. Bananas. Yeah. Yeah. Soccer fronts. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. And it it doesn't have to be strong, also. Only the feel. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material. Because people like that. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier. Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented. Um we must decide where, this meeting. Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems, um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines. And um well they're cheap, so we could use them now. Um it's not really speech recognition, it's more um like you can um talk to the chip, uh record the message and record an answer, and then once you uh talk to the remote, then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left. So if I say hi Mike, and you have recorded uh hi Mike back, then you will get that. No it doesn't does not do anything. But i it's just a Yeah it's it's cheap. No but that's the gadget they want, or the gimmicks. Yes, we we should really uh include that one, I think. Um Well, as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote. Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen, uh instead of uh extra buttons. I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that. Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a, well, conventional remote, I think. For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable. A voice recognition can be uh implemented. And uh I drew an example, but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do. Hmm? Well I have the I can draw it again, and I know what I did wrong. I didn't tick the note bo box in the. Um Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen. Yes. Um I shall draw this. If it uh works. Mm so have I. Nah. Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct. Yeah just uh the numbers. These these will be bigger in the the real design. This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen. And with this you can uh, yes, go to through the menus and that can Um the video button should be uh an apart button, because you want it to uh t, yeah, to use it fast within one uh click. Um it's Hmm? This button can also be the Menu button, we use in the menus Well we we can add another button here, but Yeah. Ah right. Well you you No no, we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button. Ah once you have an extra Menu button, you don't need that that extra option. You have uh redundancy. Yeah, if we decide to uh to implement that, maybe we should. Well they that could be anywhere. That's very small. It could be uh down here. Um. Well, not here. I yeah I suggest here. But that's just a little gap. Yeah. Well the speaker and the microphone, I think, are the same uh little hole thingy. Yeah. Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines, so they won't be uh very expensive. But This is my suggested design. Um Yes. And oh I think as you can see so, the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end, or at the bottom. But Oh, um I had some uh examples. You can uh But I did not like it very much, but Well these are quite obvious, very ugly remote. Um No, well th Yeah. Well not all. Uh this is for children but th No. W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to. Well this is a terrible Um this looks Yeah. This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens. I think we should, if it's um possible, uh one with colours, but I don't know uh Too expensive? Alright. Well Nah. Ha, even more. N Well Yeah, this is what we've just done. Right? Ah right. Not everything. Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine. I think we Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard, yeah, some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front. That Just like um most cell phones are. Yeah. Yeah. No but you you have this Yeah. Yeah, you have the re remote in your hand like this. So you feel titanium. Yeah. And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to. Yeah. Well any colour Yeah, then you you paint it in the colour you want it. The plastic is is the colour you want it. So Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Well titanium is neutral. Hmm. Yeah. Well Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours, and they don't use uh wood. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. The electrical cable uh does No we don't use an electrical cable. Yeah inside, but this is for the coffee uh machine. Yeah, but that's not what's meant here, I think. Yeah. Well I got a better one here and I will um The shared folder. I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah that's the whole idea of the front. Yes. But that's for later on. The fronts y you can do anything with them. Yeah, right For the uh initiative uh launch. Mm. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so, so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more. Yeah. Red red, blue and green you give them or something, and then you can give them uh other ones. Yeah we should do that. Mm. Yeah, we can do that. But bu we stay we stay here or something? Ah right. And take it to our rooms and uh Ah, specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. Yeah. Um Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers? Yeah I I I also uh thought Yeah. And these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped with a square one in the middle. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume, I think. Yeah, it depends, but If you turn up the volume, you always see this thingy go up. Yeah. Yeah alright. Mm. Uh I I'd say only the logo. Too much text and it gets too too busy. Well it's quite a long phrase. Ah the logo should be on the top I think. Right corner, yes. uh the text? Yeah. Uh yeah, at the back? Well you c Well uh Yes. You can The logo can be on on every uh front. Yeah, but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something. Yeah, on the backside. Well n n not not on the front side, I think. On the back Yes, you you can, yeah, push that in, so that it is always be there. Yeah. Yeah I think over here the logo. Yes we could No, they have two fronts, that. You you can Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, you can you can just And then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something. This is titanium. And this is uh F front. Yeah. With the with the curved edge. Yeah. Yeah. Tada. Yeah. Ah. Yeah, that's nice finishing touch you need. Yeah, this is the front. This is the My design. Yeah. We'll stay here I guess? Well we can uh erase an animal I guess. Uh the fourth one. Uh the fourth one is empty, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I think we have to wait? Maybe. Yeah. Aha. This has no function. We've done too much in the previous meetings. Yes, we've got nothing to do now. Its the best remote ever. Pinball. Yes, but you you get really close to the screen with your hand, and I don't think that's Hmm. We can better uh draw a design on this. Yeah, but we can't. Well We'll stay here? Or we'll get the email. Yeah. Well we'll wait a few seconds and then we'll get an email. Yeah.
Speaker D: I'm listening. Right. Great. Alright, great. Yeah, great. Alright, Trendwatch. Right. I will speak about uh latest trends trends, latest fashion updates, and uh things we must not do. Uh the trends. It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling. Uh this because of our last model was very functional, but it uh people didn't like that, so our new mo model must be very good-looking. That's uh something you uh have to take a look at. And uh the feeling has to be very great. Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great. Um there's a minus uh two times here, because this is the most important point. This is uh two times as less important, and uh same for this one. Um, technological technological innovations, that's uh regarded very highly too. Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen, uh speech uh acknowledgement, as we uh talked about earlier. So we have to have uh something like that, like we uh Right. Uh the last point is easy to use. Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself. I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that. Yeah? Yeah, I know. I think we have to go for the first one. It's the most important one. So we have to uh take that one. So it it it isn't very important that that it works easy. But it has to look great. We'll see. Yeah, right. But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow, that's real great uh great concept. Alright. Uh these are the new colours of this year. So it must be very bright, very colourful. People like this. So we we have to think uh in this direction. So i set your mind to it. Findings? Fashion update? Fruit and vegetables are cool. I am told. The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables. So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way. Uh furthermore uh material, that's your part, should be very strong. I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it, maybe in a colour or something, that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong. And that's uh also for the younger public. Yeah, that's great. But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin. So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily. Well, the don'ts. Older people like dark colours and simple shapes. Well we don't want uh older people, we want young people. So uh we're gonna turn that around. We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours. Right? Okay. We don't want wood. Old people. So, that's it for me. Yeah, we should change that. No no no. Mm. Yeah. We keep coming back to the fronts. Yeah. Fruity. Fruity. Well it's got a strong look, this. Yeah. Yeah, it still has a strong look. But then you are losing your fruity colours. That's true. Yeah but the But it doesn't have to look strong. The the results are, the feel of the material is expected to be strongy. The feel. Nah yeah the feel Right. I agree. I dunno. Yeah right. Yeah. Right. Oh okay. Right. No. But that that makes it cheap. It's it's just a an extra function, and it's cheap. No but Yeah, right. Young people love them. Yeah, ple Right. Alright. How How How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen? Alright. So you have a menu button, and then you can go up and down. Yeah right. Yeah.. You have to push hard. Yeah. Yeah. You've Right. And you you need a you need a speaker. For the Yeah. Yeah. Exit. But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part. Or don't Right, and spea speaker at the back, or something. Alright. Alright. Yeah, fine. Move on. Yeah. Nei They're n they're not trendy. It doesn't look strong. Yeah right. This is just crazy. Nah th It's too expensive. Yeah. But are we going for a strange uh form? 'Cause people like that. Not too strange. You can make the the underside, you can make it more round, where the L_C_D_ is. I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone, with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms, s something like that. You know? Yeah, but people like something uh new you know. Yeah, different. Y yis Alright. Great. Your bag. Yeah. Materials are the most, most impor Yeah. Do you know the new uh No no The front is the most important. But the feel of plastic isn't strong. Yeah alright, alright. 'Kay. Yeah. Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas Yeah, but it it's expensive. Bendable. Bendable. Yeah. Paint spray. Yeah alright. So, we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front? Yeah, great. Yeah. But then you have the problem, when you have a titanium back, you can't switch it. When you want an other colour on the front, it doesn't match. You know? I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Alright. Funky customers. Alright. Nei. So external. Yeah. Alright. I think we can launch a couple of packages. You can buy a different kind of of of machine, but it's the same thing, but with another front. So And you can you can Yeah right. Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini Yeah. It's good marketing. Yeah, n not too heavy. You can always take another pick. They have to buy it later on. Yeah right. More basic. Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing. Else it w won't sell. So Lost my mouse. Unbelievable. Yeah. Yeah togeth You can take the SMARTboard. Have fun. 'Kay. We don't have produ product yet, so kind of difficult. Ajax. Nah. Um round. Yeah. Round. Curvy. Yeah. So you can see you have to up or down. And this must be uh volume I think, and this programme. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I noticed. You can't uh click the corners. It's a real real great thing. Let's start the design. O Yeah. Me too. But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts. So Yeah, right. The logo Yeah. But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable, when you get off the front. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but you can scratch it off or something. It's better if you have it uh Yeah. I agree. But not too big. Just uh Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No no no no. You have to make this titanium too. Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_. Like dust in it and so things like that. When you exchange all the fronts and it's open. Yeah. Some some kind of wei weight in it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is. Because it has to be uh there all the time you know. So uh a little corner of titanium. So this this is the exchangeable part. Right. Taking all the credit. But there's a problem. We can't uh take a blank one. Or can we? Yeah. Nah that's alright, that's alright. This one is empty. You have to empty one huh? Alright. No Yeah. Yeah. It's not relaxing. I I don't have a laptop. Yeah right. Dream on. Half No. It's all about cool things. And it will sell. We will be rich. No. No man. You just have to push harder. Yeah. Mm. Recalibrate it. Yeah. Finish meeting now. Yeah. Oh. Alright. Have fun lads.","For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use. The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote. Materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front. The industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons (and no scroll wheel), simple battery (instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo), and advanced chip. Speech recognition can be implemented, but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions. He also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours, soft textures and curved shapes. The team drew a provisional prototype. They placed the LCD below the buttons. If it is implemented, a recording button, microphone and speaker need to be included in the design. Finally, they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved. Packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched."
107,"Speaker A: Okay, I can go? Can I? So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um. So, the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel. And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative. And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use. So, are things we are we have uh speak about before. Yeah. And um so you you can go after. And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends, uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes, shoes, and furnitures. So, maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that, or And the mm the material is expected to be spongy. Uh I don't know which material can be spongy, and if you Mm-hmm. Okay It's robust, yeah. Not good. An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that. You ca uh you can go uh before, before, yes. And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel, after is uh technological innovative, and after the easy to use. Yeah that's why Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible. Innovative. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Oh, colour, yeah. Oh i i I thought about a a pear, for example. You know the pear, is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and uh Yeah. Or a fruit like that. I dunno. Yeah. But you don't have Yeah.
Speaker B: Mm-hmm. Abdul al-Hasred is my name. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Also have to say Did you receive the email about the voice recognition? No? Yeah. You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed. Says Yeah. It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions. But I guess it could be I guess it's possible. I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command. Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff, so if they already have it as uh as a chip then we we could use it. Okay. Mm-hmm. I have a question about that actually. Um, what is the purpose of the light? Is But But in th in the dark uh Yeah but is going to be always turned on, the light? But if you move it then you have it, you don't need to find it. You can see the buttons better, of course. Yeah. But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement. Yeah, but you need another sensor for that, right? Yeah no it's too expensive. Okay. Mm. Extra. Yeah, okay. Mm. Yeah, but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so, yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. So uh my one, it uh should be in the shared folder. So. It was last time I saw it. Okay. So, just move to the next slide. So basically want very simple, right? That's the major idea, as simple as possible. So I just look at some current designs uh on the web, of usually more complicated remote controls. And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple. And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler. Um. So. Yeah. Well this these uh these remotes are quite big, so go to the next page, so. We have all these buttons as you can see, but most of them, we just need the ones in the middle. So, from the bottom or whatever is there, uh the uh the numbers and then the top, uh until the ten also, this middle part, and on the left one is exactly the same. So it's basically more or less how we would like it, with a big volume control, big channel control, and mute and power, yeah? These are the basic thing. So basically, w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two. Yeah, if you have, for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb. It could be on the right side, for example. Yeah. Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have. And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because you open it, it can break, you ca you can do various things. Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way. So that they're separate a bit, yeah. Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons, but uh, it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either. Mm. Yeah, I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user. Alright, you won't yeah. Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with, like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that. Yeah. That you want to protect a bit. And I think it's uh it's reasonable. So, I don't think Yeah, this is just the the wheel. We could use the some wheels can be pushed down, could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want. Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case. Yeah, I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that. Mm-hmm. Well, wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing, it it would work, right? Yeah. You can throw it to the television. Hey that's a cool one. We could say that if you throw it, you have a sensor, and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off. When it d uh takes a shock. Yeah. How do we make it look cool is the question. Yeah. Well the obvious thing is a banana, I guess. The banana is also ergonomic. Is there any fruit that is spongy? Yeah. You can make it um It's not hard, the metal. Plastic. Mm. Yeah. Two of the button, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve, yeah, and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side. So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool, no? You can put also vibrator inside. Ah-ha. You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company. Yeah. I hope the students of management die, but anyway. Now who are recording this meeting? The only th Yeah. Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure. But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move, right? So, it's going to be bend a lot. So if we try to push the buttons, it You think it's possible? Okay. Yeah. Well, usually hold 'Kay, we want it to be good also for the left-hand users, right? Uh Yeah but okay. Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides, one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb. Basically. Or you could use use this one, but I don't know if it's very comfortable, to use this one for the wheel. This for the wheel and then this for the buttons? Should have the two sides. So if the left, we have the op Wheel Wheel buttons. Yeah, the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around, the buttons are on the other side. So you cannot see them. Yeah. So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be Y Yeah I know, but uh if you hold with your left hand, and the wheel is here, and the buttons are here, then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side. Okay. Okay. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yes master. No. Yeah. Yeah. No. Maybe you can make uh uh mm okay.
Speaker C: Uh, I_D_ you want? Yeah. I only v have three slides, so. I just look at the mm um just this. On some web pages to find some documentation and I think a remote control is, as I s mentioned previously, you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control. So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip, which is uh very very standard, and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button. And um yeah we can change directly. In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control. The push button are usually extremely cheap, but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor, which seems to be quite expensive. And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button. Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button. Yeah. Yeah I I th But I don't think that uh we should We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money. But Um that's all yeah. I haven't chec Mm-hmm. Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry, I haven't written my personal references. Um the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button, and if we could reduce that. We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button. Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber Yeah. Actually. As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light. Yeah. Again. I don't think that this is really expensive, but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control, when you want to turn off your device Yeah, a little bit. A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. To s Mm-hmm. I support an apple. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Ah it's okay. I know that they do that for alarm clock also. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What about um And for maybe look and feel, what about a a piece of ice, with blue L_E_D_ inside? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Banana I think, it's a nice idea. Because But You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that, but when the banana is curving like that, with the wheel on the top and to control, and here you have a a push button to Yeah. And everybody knows what is a banana. Basically. If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha Oh, yeah So So we will just use a a standard battery? And uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use. Uh what do you mean by case? Yeah. Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case, doesn't matter. I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box, and that's it. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Spongy also. Oh no I think it's possible. Yeah. Yeah. This is uh like the Mm-hmm. Wheel on the top. Button, where do we want some buttons? Yeah. Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Thank you.
Speaker D: Okay. So we are here for the concept design meeting. So, we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken. Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards. So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours. We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task, to have to be done before the next meeting. So, last time we decided to have a simple interface. We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button. Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple. We have also button for volume, and to switch on off the T_V_. We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find, and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features. So now uh we will have three presentations. So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer, the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ okay. And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert. So maybe we can start with uh industrial design. So this is the presentation. Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. But is it a significant price on the whole remote control? Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control. So will will will this with uh including all possible things, so buttons, wheel and the chip, be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce? Okay You received something Hmm. And could it be adapted? Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff? Okay. Yeah. Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news. Okay. You can easily find the button in the dark or so? It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think, no? Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. True. But it can be uh battery consuming, no? To have the light always on? Well we will discuss that after maybe the other presentations. Yeah. And it is. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And also does it uh fit well in hand? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's only the central part. Yeah. With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. S Okay. Will be down or Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors. Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple. So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect. Okay. So we can move to the Is there any question? For designer of user interface? or we can move to the next part, maybe, and discuss afterwards? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. This is good also for Yeah. I think it is good also f to have a spongy material, yeah. Yeah, because it's robust. Yeah uh sorry? No. Yeah. Before? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has. Has it? Yeah. I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative. So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept. Cool, fancy? We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable. Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh, things like that. Maybe yeah. Yeah, and it's ergonomic as well. A pear. Yeah. Maybe pear yeah or something like that. Yeah. We can discuss that uh. D D Is is there anything you want to add? I don't think so. I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good, fit well, or banana as you told. Something like that. But that's not in the trend.. The trend is spongy, and vegetable fruits. I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well. So, I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy, it's innovative, even if the cost is a bit higher, and we also have to find a, so, a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have. What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with? Odi Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then. I think it's a good idea, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then. Maybe we can keep the banana. And it will be very easy to find. Yeah. Yeah it's really uh really a good point. I think it So One second. So we have to take some decision on this aspect. So, uh so for sorry, for uh component, so we have to think about those aspects, sorry. Yeah. I think it's the box that should be spongy, banana's shape. But No the button would be In fact it it should be something odd shaped, with a spongy cover. Okay odd shape with spongy cover. And standard battery okay, a chip imprint, there's no specific problem. So we agree to put the wheel So it have to it has to be symmetrical. Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable. Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left. Mm. I think you can turn it this way also. You can do both with both hands. I think it's okay. Well, you you will get used to it. And moreover, th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side, because you have light on buttons. Yeah. No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand, whether you are righty or lefty. I think for lefty it's okay. I can do this movement, and for righty as well. I think this doesn't change that much. Yeah? So, for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side. And and uh a wheel on the top. So the colour is yellow. I think it's uh we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take, yeah. So maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting. So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision. And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product. That is to say, uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users, but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay. It seems to be fancy, innovative, and easy to use. So so to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together. That would uh be better, I think. And uh And so uh you will receive further instruction by emails, as usual. So do you need to add anything? You feel okay? You feel uh free to express what you want to say? You don't feel too constrained? You don't feel free to answer this? Okay, so See you.","So we are here for the concept design meeting . So , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours .

Hey, it's blue. No. Whatever. Um, I like its ugliness and uh Yeah, whatever. The way it walks or whatever. Your turn. Drawing. Or a line. I mean a bird. Hmm. It's a handicapped cat. He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness. I wouldn't call it training, but Alright. I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls, but if you see elderly people, all these buttons, and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever. And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places, and half of the functions a are removed, or whatever. Uh, so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with uh grouped buttons, you know. All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh Well, one area or whatever, not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um, yeah, to minimise it to this this or whatever o o other functions totally somewhere else. I think we should group them. And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder, and not with a stereo, I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players, recorders. Yeah. I don't know. Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television. Yes. Yes, it is only for television, but uh Well well we we're gonna brainstorm about that. If we think it's useful, we do it. That's right. It's a television remote control. But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_ Yep. Yeah, also no one's gonna buy it. I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, way too high. Yep. Well that's an idea of course, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, what the market wishes. Yeah. You just got a message. And it said uh five minutes, so we got four and a half. No. He's the whatever. Team Leader. He is the whatever. Yes. Project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white-board. Yeah. Yes. Alright. Okay. Yeah. No. I don't think so. Yes? Great. Yeah. Good luck. I will need it.
Speaker B: I've lost my screen. Uh Yes. I closed the No. Yes. Antek. 'Kay. I'm going to draw a cat. I don't know why, but a cat is a very uh smart animal. And you can have them at home. Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and Ye yes, yeah. It's not very uh very good drawn, but you can see a cat from it. It's Ah, it's not scared. He's crying but Uh it's i most cats are small. You can handle them. Yes. Yes, Yes, that's uh something extras. Yeah. Only the experts. Uh, to go with to go with fashion and Team Leader. No. Oh.
Speaker C: And then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot. It's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here. No. Yeah. Try the power button. Huh. Yeah, my name is name. Yeah? Everybody's ready? Great. Well, welcome to the kick-off meeting. I uh forgot to put my name over here, it's uh it's Martin. Uh, so you all know. Well, this is the agenda for today. Well, the opening is what I'm doing right now. Uh, we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things. Uh give some um examples of the tool training, project plan discussion and the closing. We have twenty five minutes. Okay, the project aim is to design a new remote control. Uh, some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly. So now we all know what our goal is. Um, I oh forget I forget the whole acquaintance part, but we we all know each other. We all know each other's names. Joost, Guido, Antek. Okay. I think we uh al already uh been through that part. Okay, it consists of uh three levels of design. Uh we begin with the functional design, then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design. Every uh level of design consists of some individual work, and we uh close it with a meeting. You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions, and uh you p you probably read that already, so I don't have to tell you about that. Okay, first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here, so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools. We have the smart-boards, uh the thes those two boards. This is the presentation boards, wh which one I'm using right now. You can uh um there's a document folder called um the sh shared document folder. You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here, so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen. We also have the white-board. Uh, we're gonna skip through th No, no. Just on the on the screen over there. Oh, no. Probably is, but I don't know if the software is on the laptop. Is is if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting, so I don't think it's I don't know if it's important. This an explanation of the smart-boards. There is a tool-bar over here. It's quite simple. You have the the pen function, eraser function. It's like a very simple uh paint application. Uh, we well, we use the same file during uh the whole day, and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button. It works like this. Oh. If pen is selected, yes. Oh, no no. It's not But it is pen. It's not working like a pen yet. Huh. Huh. It's doing some stuff now. So you can use a pen. You can use an eraser. And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks, and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward, which y you have to select pen format. And then select current colour or line width. So, it's quite easy. Uh well, now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools. Right, we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards. Uh, every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics, on blank sheets with different colours, with different pen widths. Uh, I'll start off then. I'll use this uh same sheet. Alright. Oh, let me think. Different colours. Oh. Well, I'm gonna draw um a p piranha. Uh, a fish. Uh. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna use some different colour now. Some a little white. Looks like a fish. Think it is. Oh. Oh. Uh, colour. This is black? I think so. Oh. Oh, this is just uh useless uh drawings but Oh teeth. I need teeth. Well, they're not supposed to be green, or whatever colour this is. Okay. What was uh I have su to sum up its favourite characteris Well, I like its uh sharp razor sharp teeth. Plus, uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh, well a small actual face. And I like its overall uh aggressive look and Well, that's what I like about uh piranha. I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be. Well, who wants to be next? You go, Guido? Okay. Uh, make a new sheet. Uh, it's by pressing on blank. Yep. Yep. And uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths. Well, tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. No, uh it's clear. N no no. We get your point. Okay. Who wants to be next? Oh. I'll do so. Okay. Well, you can have a piranha at home. Huh. I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that.. Okay. What do you like about it then? Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, and then we are uh through the tool training, I guess. Okay, this is uh something about the project finance. The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros. And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros. We're very ambitious on this one. The market range is international, so it's gonna be sold world-wide, and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control. So that's clear. Yeah? Okay, we're now gonna discuss some stuff when well, we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be. Uh, well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls. Do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls? Or do they annoy you sometimes? Are they difficult to understand, or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well? Yeah, okay. Okay. Different functions of of uh Okay. Yeah. Okay. And uh, is it gonna be a remote control that's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment, like your T_V_ and your home stereo? Uh Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But uh, the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably. It's what, from my experience. Okay. But we gonna Oh, it is only for televis So wha what What wha what uh what document But, where where did it uh Where did you find that? Oh, okay. Yeah, but most television remote controls support other functions as well. So we can No, we have to think about that. Okay, uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness, is a is a pri priority in this case, or Okay. Well, this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh, or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful. That w Well, then you're you're the usability uh man, so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then. Okay. Well, other ideas? How can we make it trendy or something? Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it? Maybe a can opener underneath it? I don't know. Or someth something special, like uh M_P_ three player inside of it, or uh Oh, well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably. Okay. Maybe with different type of fronts or uh Well, m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it We gonna skip back to the goals probably. Uh, original, trendly, and user-friendly Well, we al also already talked about user-friendliness. No, well something trendy and original, well that that goes hand in hand I guess. When something is original, it tends to be trendy, probably, or we should make it combination of that. 'Kay, so you the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for, so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh, you know, you want to manage with it. Well, and that's an important part for you then, with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it. Well, and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy. Well, you know, y like some special feature. Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something. Okay. Well, the closing. Next meeting starts in thirty minutes. Individual, I think so. The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design, of course, we will uh Already s said that. The User Interface Designer is it a User Inter User Interface the technical functions design. And the Management Expert of uh the Marketing Expert. User requirements specifi Well, this one was already clear to us. Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. I don't know how much time we have left. Oh, not many I guess. We started at twelve. Oh, and what does it said? W Okay, well um No, we're uh ahead of schedule then. Yeah, close it. I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes. And uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations. You can all Or we're all uh Yeah. Yeah, but we're all familiar with uh uh Microsoft PowerPoint, are we? Yeah, okay. I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down and then we're ready. Or we can leave already I guess. or uh or sh or should we uh or is important that we leave at exact uh Okay. Yes. We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes. Yeah, good luck.
Speaker D: Okay. No, that's okay. Joost, your mouse. No mouse needed? Mm. A touch-pad? Slap it. Is Um F_ five. F_ five. I don't. You've got your name. Hope it working. Never close your laptop. Yeah. Okay. What is your name? Antek Ahmet. And Joost. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Can we see the white-board on our laptops? No, I saw I saw the file, the smart-board that X_B_K_ but Okay. With that pen? Mm. Mm. Little bit slower. piranha. Okay. Oh. Yellow Hmm. Different. Okay. I will try. Yeah. I will try. Uh Blank? Okay. Then pen again? Okay. Okay, um control. Uh Ah, purple. Um, I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is, but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird. Uh I will That's my bird. Yeah? Isn't it quite it's a little bit light. Uh, another colour maybe. A red one. A small one. Uh, line width. Two? Three. Oh that's okay. That's another one. Ano Uh uh it's a Yeah, it's uh the most simple uh animal I know, I think. Um, I don't know. Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that. Maybe a little bit. Yeah. I don't know. So more uh birds? Okay, okay, okay. M Pictionary. A cow. Okay. Yeah, it's little bit hard. Orange, of course. Uh yeah. Yeah. True. A little bit. Yeah. Don't mess with my birds, yeah. cat. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Different. Yeah. But isn't it It's only for television, I thought. Not I thought it was only for television. So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_. Uh, in the email. I thought it said uh Yeah, television remote control. True. Yeah. True. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. True. Oh my God. Okay. For the bear. Uh I I uh, no I think it Uh, I th I think yo we have to keep it simple, to get a whole market. It's international, so we have to use a standard. Hmm. Use friendly. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Interface d Oh, I don't I didn't get a message. Oh, the Project Manager. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I don't think Oh I will need it.","The marketing expert and industrial designer had problems with their laptops. The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project, to design a remote control. The remote should be trendy, original and user friendly. The project manager explained how to use the SMARTboard, and the group did a tool training exercise, using the SMARTboard to draw their favourite animals. The project manager talked about the budget and projected profit. The group discussed initial ideas for the remote, including that it should be a simple design with grouped buttons. They discussed whether the remote should include functions for controlling video and DVD players. The project manager went over the roles of the participants and closed the meeting."
29,"Speaker A: Yes. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Like the skin? Yeah. Okay. So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber. Okay. And the buttons obviously are rubber. Okay. Mm-hmm. I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before. So it seems we'd have to do more research on it. Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack. Yeah so there's there is a one battery, because most remotes use two batteries I believe. So, if it was running off of one battery as a Right. Although it needs some light, doesn't it? So, if we're doing yeah. If we're Yeah. Yeah. I think sometimes it's just shoved under, under a cushion, and yeah. Yeah. So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect? The infrared is like, that's considered a Okay. So when it says pointing device that doesn't include Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. I think if we go with the um design plate thing, we'll have to. Just because of colour clashing, and if we wanted to, so and, and we might, I mean, depending on what comes out of the design, we might have to stick to just black buttons. You mean different colours for the lighting or Mm-hmm. Oh I see what you're saying. Well y Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back. I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards. But, but I guess, you mean from the back. Okay. Okay. Right. Mm-hmm. Oh. Yeah. They, they insert over. Okay. T Okay is that my turn then? Alright. I have a shorter report for you today. Um, it took a while to get this, uh Uh. Oh. That's a very good point. Okay, so um, this report is about uh trend-watching. Um, basically so we can live up to our, our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control. Sorry. There we go. Um So, just so you know, my method was mainly web web-based research this time around. I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan, New York and Paris. And I looked at the design reports from previous years, here at Real Remote. Um, just so c we can work off of them, see how fashions have changed. Um, so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across. Um, and they, they're each more important than the one that comes after it. Uh, the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look-and-feel. Um, this should be our priority, as we've been saying. The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative. So, I think we've done a lot of talking about that, just with lighting and the buttons and the face-plates. Um, so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that. And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use. So, pretty basic there. And the recent fashion update, uh, according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan, is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. Um, also, in contra uh in contrast to last year, the feel of the material is expected to be spongy. Again, we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons. Um So, my personal preferences here, um of course, as we, we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting, and I'd like to stick to that. The fruits and vegetable themes, I don't know if that's going to work for us. It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware. I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes. It could be one of the options. Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen. Um, the temporary light-up idea, sounds like we're gonna stick to that. And then, uh, tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness. Mm-hmm. It's, it's a little but it, it's everywhere. So maybe we I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them, you know. But I I think, I think if we stick to T_V_ based, you know, maybe T_V_ shows, or Or colour schemes. Right. Yeah. The The essence of strawberry. Yeah. I guess, yeah. One thing I was thinking though is I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting, we talked about our favourite animals. So maybe there could be animal-based, you know. Because a lot of people have a house cat. Or, or a dog. Um, that might be getting, you know, too specific, and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are. But it's something to keep in mind. And, did you have any questions? Pretty straightforward? Okay. There you go. Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the okay. The PowerPoint? So So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it? Okay. Mm-hmm. Oh, is regular not simple? Right right right. Think it was called command interface. Command interface,. Mm-hmm. That was on, um one of my presentations. About how often it was used. Do you remember that? I w Should I bring it up? The ch t Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour. So tw twice every once every two hours. Um, and it was considered a one point five relevance, on a scale of ten. That's brightness, colour, tone, all that. Mm-hmm. The other one was audio settings. Mono, stereo, pitch. I mean I sometimes use that. Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style, movie style, um and that, they say that's used zero point eight times an hour, which is actually somewhat high. Like almost once an hour. Um, relevance of two. Well that didn't some up on mine. Oh. Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing, 'cause it, mm it is a good sales ploy to say, aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons. This one has channel, volume and your channe and your power. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas? Like f five different Mm-hmm. Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons, it's true. Yeah. I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well. So it's a something that will, you know, appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds. Something that your granny would want on her remote control. Um, and international tastes as well, so Not easy. Okay.
Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Should be just loading. Okay. Oh, although I can't see it on my screen. That says go here. Okay. I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use, um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control. Um, first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made, and what is it happens inside the casing, which is more your field. Um, thes main internal feature is a circuit board, which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source. Which is not necessarily a battery, as we're about to see. Um, there are several components of, um, the circuit board that we need to consider, where we'll be getting them from, what they'll be made of. Um, including the integrated circuit, which is also known as the chip. Which is where all the main information is uh contained. Um, diodes, transistors, resonators, resistors, and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well. Um, and all their positioning in the circuit. Uh, these, they're all different options, they're all separate, apart from the chip, which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple, a regular, advanced. We can go into that later. Um, all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately, and work out the most, like, effective um circuit, including all the wires and everything like that. And the L_E_D_ of course, that's a light emitting diode. So, we could, so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things, with that as well. Okay, there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source. We could use a basic battery, but that brings with it, like they need to be recharged and the bulk, the size of it as well. And they're not so great to dispose of, environmentally. There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago. A bit out of date. Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed. Um, where you manually charge up the power. Like you wind up something. Sorry? Yeah. Every once in a while I think. But it's Yeah. It would be like going a step back in time. I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology. Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices, where you just shake the device and it gives it power. I mean, the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work. Um, or there's solar power, which we've been considering inside a building, which is where it's gonna be used, might not be quite so useful. But, good to look into, renewable energy, always the way. Um, lots of considerations for the case, like what sort of shape it would be, curved or flat. That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics. Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand. We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up. Or too small. Or too slidy. I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back, 'cause it had so many buttons on, and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button. Because you can't really see which way round it is. Um, we also can choose what materials um, the we could use metal, we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_. It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that, so it's very like soft, not so stressful on your hands. Wood. Um, again, stepping back in time again there. I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here. Um, titanium is not gonna be possible, even though it just it beyond our budget really. But, would've been maybe for future projects. Um right our choice for buttons as well. We've developed some we've got some good advances in technology, with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons. I think that was brought up for, um, they're basically quite a flexible design, modern, you don't have to use individual buttons. You can just slide up and down. I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads. Yeah. That's true. And that would lead to an advanced yeah. If we have yeah. We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip. And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget. Um, also we've got the integrated pushbutton, which is what we're most familiar with. It's the most straightforward. But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well.. Got decisions to make there. And this is what I was just saying before. Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs. Um simple would go with the pushbutton. Um, regular you could link with the scroll button. And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display. My personal preferences? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source. I don't, I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology. It's not been seen before, so it could be quite a, a novelty factor, attractive as well. And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy, you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels. You just give it a shake. Sounds brilliant to me. Rubber casing I thing would probably the best, if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics. Like it could be pretty much any colour we want. Um, and gives you, yeah, more flexibility there. And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple, then we could possibly have the scroll and the push, but no L_C_D_, 'cause we probably can't afford that one. Mm-hmm. I think that would, uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing. And the rubber would just be the, what's in contact with the human. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe if the, um, if it was just kind of a, more of a rubber coating which was on to a case. So, it was kind of, the whole thing would be removable. Yeah. Like I can't think of what. Yeah. Or like an you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something, that's just it's protective as well. It, it stops it, I mean, it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something, as well, 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily. I think i maybe a mixture of both there, maybe. Yeah. And then yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As far as I know. It should be. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I thought that was Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like as a backup for something. Yeah. Yeah. Some alternative just in case something went wrong. That's true. I just thought of that. Yeah. Yeah. May maybe that could be the backup. Instead of a battery. Like solar backup. Yeah. I suppose s but some But thing is, it's not you don't need the solar all the time. It can be stored. It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it. It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day. Like a few hours a day.. That's true. It could easily Yeah. I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think, oh no, I forgot to charge my remote today. Like if the kinetic thing, I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy. You don't have to, you know, you can shake it a few times, or whatever. And it works. Yeah. Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and. K okay. Yeah. There we go. it wasn't on mine either. I don't know why. I think, I just, I just used the mouse on there. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. So I suppose sometime after you. Mm. I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol. And if you wanted to go onto teletext or, I know we're not having that, but I mean a similar thing, you, they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it, which I suppose it's that sort of thing like the, the symbol on the button. But if we're having a simplified display anyway, w that, we probably won't have to focus so much on that. It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume. I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume, display, and stuff like that. I For inp Mm. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things. It can be a bit, yeah, overwhelming. Yep. Oh. I'd assume, like, an internal light, that comes through. So there would have to, have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons, or something. Yeah, yeah. It should be able to mm-hmm. Li yeah. Mm-hmm. I think it would be possible. I don't think it would make that much difference. I mean, the uh the dimensions of it. 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone. You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons. And then you get to the circuit. I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the, the top casing. I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing, without causing too much difficulty. I'm sure that'd be fine. Okay. You're not plugged in yet. Mm. It is strange. Well We I think we possibly could take a more abstract design. Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables. And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes. I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry, but it could have the curves of a strawberry, or something. Or a strawberry seed or a leaf. Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract, if that's fits in more with what we're doing. Instead of fruits and vegetables, just if you look at it straightforward, it's a bit yeah. It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well, obviously it does, if that's the current theme. But may maybe we could go more directly, I don't know. But initially, I dunno. I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit. Yeah and like not, not yeah. Mm. Yeah. I didn't for the first one. But I have now. Yeah. Uh, hopefully. Project documents I think. Okay. 'Kay. Kinetic yeah. Are we going to have a backup? Or do we just I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy, and be bold and innovative, and hope this works, and well hope that it works. I think yeah. I think no. I, I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential. Go for it. It could be fully kinetic energy. Yeah. Is everyone happy with that? Yeah. Um, it was whether we went for the simple, the regular, or the advanced chip. And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have, so Yeah, it was so that was without the L_C_D_. So that means we're not doing the advanced. So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons. Uh, so that's the simple. Yeah possibly. So, it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need. So it's a medium. So regular chip. Regular sorry. Regular chip. Lighting. Yeah if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well. So th I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case, which we will decide on rubber. Rubber. Yeah. Plastic rubber coat. Interchangeable, yeah. Still going for that. Yeah. Your screen? Was it Ouch. The power. Volume. May yeah. Tone, contrast, and things. That's a bit Yeah, it was minima well, it wasn't the l Yeah. That would be good. Yeah, and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television, so Mm. I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself, doesn't it? I'm sure it has its own buttons, so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote. Yeah. So we're just going for power, channels, volume, Mm. I've Yeah, that's it. We can just go for, make it a selling point that it is just the basic. Yeah uh I brilliant. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um, I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect. Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research, I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something, because even if that may not seem obvious to us, if that's what the surveys brought out, I think that we should probably go along with that. Um, so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development. But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg? Y Yeah. We can have a look at those ideas, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tricky. A lot of things to consider. Hm. Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Speaker C: Is everyone ready to start? Okay. Great. Well, welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design. I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running. Okay. Um, on the agenda for this, um, for this particular meeting, we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting, after we came up with um some general ideas of our design. And, um, then we have to make some key decisions on, on our remote control concept, and how we're gonna make it, what uh materials we're gonna use, and that sort of thing. The meeting will be forty minutes long. And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter. Alright, and I will switch up PowerPoint. Okay. Um Are they all included, like mandatorily, or r are these different options? Yeah. Mm. Um What is a hand-powered dynamo? Just every, every once in a while? Just every once in a while or constantly? Alright. It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think. No. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Um one thing with the scroll buttons though. It, it we would have to have an L_C_D_ um display, and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Um, one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as like as the exterior. This is the one thing that's protecting its innards. Yeah. Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates. Um, is it I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there. Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate. It would work that way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. So maybe the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds good. I, um, is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber? Okay, we'll just say yeah. Yes, just why not. Alright. I like the kinetic energy source idea. Um, I don't know when people will, um, be moving a remote around a lot. But I think that it's worth it, kinetety, kinetic um energy source. It could make an we could have any kind of style. It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky, and Yeah. Just for environmental reasons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then. Yeah. I think that might be a little impractical though. Yeah. Like people don't wanna have to worry about that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it. Yeah. Alright. Cool. 'S that the end of your presentation. Alright. Thank you. Yeah. That's um Oh. Okay. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause I'm sorry? Um, because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard, so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard. You're pressing the numbers for, um, for what you want. Yeah, we'll be doing Yeah. It'd be more a command interface, and then Yeah. Hmm? Yeah. I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things. Yeah. Yeah. What do you mean? Oh yeah, like how the buttons Yeah, as a button though. So, it's a keyboard in the shape of it, right? Okay. Yeah. I like that idea. Yeah. I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget. A bit more too, yeah. Mm-hmm. Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour, just to keep it, give it a simplistic look. Yeah. Yeah. But what about the lighting up effect? Um, well, um, I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up. And so if they were black, it wouldn't be possible for them to light up. If they were white they would glow, probably. If they were made out of rubber. Oh. Where would the light come from? Yeah. Yeah, and well rubber is a more translucent product too, so we have that taken care of. Oh. Mm. Well, if they're raised up buttons. So that you can feel them. We were talking about it being more um, a lot more tangible. Um, it might be more difficult to do. If they're, if they're sticking up. If it's flat then, like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone, it's like all very flat, and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons, but Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Alright. If it's do-able we can do. Yeah, sounds good to me. Alright, thank you. That means you're up. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring. Everything else we can really, we can really um, do, according to our plans already, given the market. But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control. Yeah. Yeah. But they still need to um fit into people's decor though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tone it down. Yeah, like more like photos of fruit, on, on our product. Mm-hmm. Yeah um Alright, given that information, we need to start making some more specific decisions. So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again. But it's still around right? Okay. Okay. I'm just trying to make this pop up now. Alright. Here we go. Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do. So energy, we oh. Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting. Does anyone know how to take it out of Um, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um, so back to decisions. Energy, we've decided on kinetic, right? Okay, so that's good. Hmm. But would a backup really be necessary? I mean will people just use the battery if there's no, if there's, if there is backup. Yeah. Yeah. There's like no reason why it wouldn't work, right? Yeah. It could even be one of our selling points. Yeah. Yeah. Environmentally conscious or something. Yeah. Alright, the next um decision is chip on print. I don't exactly know what that means. Right, and we were going for more simplistic style, right? Yeah. I think we decided on the pushbuttons, right? Yeah. Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting, the interior lighting system? Yeah? Okay. That's called medium, or regular? 'Kay. Okay, and cases. Um, does this, is this dependent on shape, or what it's made of, or what? Yeah. Well, I guess plastic and coated in rubber. Plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable um yeah, interchangeable plates. Okay. User interface concept. This is your time to shine. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Command interface. Did you say command line? Okay. Line interface. Alright, and supplements. What's that all about? Um Mm-hmm. Um, what are our choices here? You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels, and we'll have the channel-changer, and volume, and power? Um Yeah. Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels, things like that, because different televisions will have Um, yeah. Yep. Yeah, it was hardly ever used really. Yeah. And most televisions will come with a remote. Yeah. 'Kay, well we know we want numbers. Yeah, it does. Yeah, and different televisions. Like we, I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of changes like that. Volume. Yeah. Oh. We have five minutes to finish our meeting. Crap. Okay, um, let's do this fast. Um Should we have audio? It only comes up on mine usually. Yeah, I don't, I it's, it's a problem with the international uh appeal, I think. Um, if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work. But we know that everyone has this and it's the same. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Good. And, okay, in closing, 'cause we only have five minutes. We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes. Um, you'll be working, Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design. Wait a minute. Is that right? Yep, and um the user interface design, so this is where the trendy stuff comes in. And you'll be evaluating the product. Um, Poppy and Tara will have to work together, using modelling clay. And, um, your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen. Alright. So, anyone else have something to say? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. five.. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Lots of yeah. Alright. 'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then. Alright. And, um, we'll reconvene in thirty minutes. 'Kay. Bye. I'll see you later. Oh, what did I just do. Okay.
Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. W Like plastic with rubber, kind of on top Well, there's, there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing, b like a Nokia it is. It's yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, tha Backup. Yeah. That would be good yeah. Maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors, but a lot of calculators, yeah, have solar power. So maybe that could be incorporated as Yeah. Do, do those calculators yeah. I don't know how it works. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I suppose. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Oh. It's not on my screen. Why? You don't know why? Oh okay. Is it that one? Um, I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now. Uh, first of all I'll explain what a user interface is. It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived, for example, heard or felt maybe, or by the human user. And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data. Um, there are two types of user interfaces. There's the graphical user interface, which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device, for example a mouse for input control. So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about. Yeah. I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen. Or maybe it's the the buttons or pictures or something. Do you think it's Yeah. Yeah. So you must, for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics. Like an L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the, that's on the buttons of the remote control, and per Well it could be a wee scroller thing, and something could come up on the screen. Yeah. But um I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway, to make it more simplistic. But the, we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points, as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe. Like I can't think of an example, but Sort of like little pictures rather than Like a little sound. Instead of saying volume, like a little speaker or something. Yeah, something y Yeah m perha yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Um, the co uh we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control. As it would be less complicated, and the controls would be more user-friendly. Um, the remote control would be cheaper to design, so that we'd have more money in the budget to, um, target the design area of the interface. You know, make it more trendy and original. We'll have more money if we keep it simple. Yeah. Seeing as it's quite a new technology. Um We, we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our, um, more user-friendly remote control, that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons, that, um, that their functions, colours and forms aren't always helpful. Yeah. Yeah. And that all interfaces are different. So, um, that doesn't improve the use of the produ product, so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand. And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use. Does anyone have any questions? Mm. But um Yeah. In the phone that I was thinking of as well, when you change the um covers of it, the, the little buttons that actually, you know, that contro control stuff, are behind the rubber. So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces. Do you know what I mean? 'Cause it's just the wee control, yeah, thing that's behind it. So I mean, we don't have to decide on one colour. Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's everything, then? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or banana-shaped. Yeah. Where do you have to save it to? Okay. Just escape I think. Yeah. Yeah. Hope so. Yeah. Yeah. I don yeah. Yeah. It's for the lighting, yeah. Yeah. Yeah plastic coat. We decided on the component. I, I I'm sorry, I've lost my um PowerPoint thing, so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component The command inter The command line interface yeah. Yeah. Um, I think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions, colours and forms, in the in consistent use. Like what what are ideas to combat these problems? You know how um different interfaces are very different, and can be confusing because because of their difference, and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have. We haven't really decided what to do about that. Well it's just um w where where shall we locate the buttons. What kind of functions wi shall we have? So pretty just just the basic button functions. Yeah. Yeah, each television. You don't change that often, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else, just have an audio button though. Do you know? But we Yeah. That could be a sales pitch. Simple and Yeah. Yeah. What I What I was thinking what do yous think of this? Um, having the numbers kind of like, not a bunch of grapes, but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle. Like grapes. Like that's kind of fruity or something. That's just Yeah. Okay.","Well on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . The meeting will be forty minutes long . And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ? they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well . Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery , There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed . Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . Um right our choice for buttons as well . with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . we would have to have an L_C_D_ um and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult . Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . My personal preferences ? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable . you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just it's protective as well . So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ? As far as I know . It should be . Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack . Like as a backup for something . you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power . May maybe that could be the backup . I think that might be a little impractical though . Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . Um , there are two types of user interfaces . There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . Like an L_C_D_ screen . It'd be more a command interface , But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that . It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume . No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic . We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful . It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming . But what about the lighting up effect ? Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards . I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something . and well rubber is a more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of . Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ? 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . this report is about uh trend-watching . And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . um of course , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring . It's , it's a little but it , it's everywhere . I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . So maybe there could be animal-based , you know . Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ? I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . It could even be one of our selling points . I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ? Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ? So regular chip . Uh , so that's the simple . is regular not simple ? because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well . Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber . yeah , interchangeable plates . and supplements . What's that all about ? what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use . We haven't really decided what to do about that . just just the basic button functions . Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of So we're just going for power , channels , volume , Should we have audio ? it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . 'cause it , mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . Um , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design . and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . And you'll be evaluating the product . Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay . And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , are you gonna come up with casing ideas ? Like f five different Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle . what do yous think of this ? Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true . I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well . So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . 'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then ."
57,"Speaker A: No no n You should write y the name I think. Me Ah yeah. Yeah. Caramel. And you I think I'm too short for the cables. Quite squarey. He also. Mm. Mm-hmm. I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part. I think If we don't have so many buttons could be nice. Yeah. Something which is not squarey maybe uh, not a box. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And I think we should have a device Sorry. Yeah. directly. Yeah. And I I think we should have something, most of the time I I lose my remote control. We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping. Ah yeah. Yeah. Barks. Yeah. Yeah whistle. Whistle tracking. Yeah. yeah Okay. Don't panic. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah.
Speaker B: Hmm. Mm mm mm. Is recorded? Okay? Okay so welcome everyone. So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control. So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff, then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it. And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process. So sorry? You have another meeting soon? So you have to be quick. Okay. So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original, we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly. So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points. First it will be the functional design. Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design. So the functional design is to identify the main user needs, the technical function the remote control should fulfil. And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved, what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that. And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point. So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board. Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us? Okay that's good. n n You should If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh I'll let you uh comment. Okay it's an abstract drawing. I think it's nice and original. Okay. You want to draw something Christine? Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost. Is this uh Ah okay it's pretty. Okay it's your cat. Okay. Olivier, do you want to Okay I go, but next time you'll do something I'm sure. I'm a bit short on cable. Okay. So what could I draw? Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow. I don't know if it looks like a cow Like a what? I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact I would say. Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control. Okay. Let's move on. So Here the uh financial objective of our project. That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros. Yeah if it's trendy, original I d fulfil the user needs. We have to discuss that point. On yeah you you can suggest points like this. So what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple. So what's what are your ideas about that? Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side? Okay, so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device. Do you agree? Yeah. So maybe it should be for multiple devices. And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil? Few buttons. Okay. And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark? Might be a good idea. Okay. And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain, what it shouldn't it should look like, or things like that? With rou okay. Like for okay. Okay. So. Fit in your hand, yeah. And also it have, i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh To, to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall. Water-proof as well. Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others can't. Maybe water-proof would be very original. Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath. That could be uh Yeah but, it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very Yeah, mayb B But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well. Yeah. Maybe we can sell uh all that together, so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well. That might be good uh track to follow. Optional or selled with it? Yeah. Maybe we can have uh But we don't design the T_V_. Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep. Yeah, barks, yeah. So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control? I don't know, whistle-able? Th Whistle tracking yeah. Whistle tracking remote control. That's a good idea, that's very original and that's can uh improve. Yeah d d uh. Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors. I think this is a good advantage. Yeah. We have to ask Yeah. We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer. Which is you. Okay so try to find that for next meeting. Okay. So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh. Don't pani. So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed. So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons, the the fact that is lighted or not, things like that, and what would be convenient for the user. And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements, what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user. So. And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon. So. Thank you I think that's all for this point. Anyway you will receive some messages. Be careful. You eat it? Does it move uh? Okay, but I don't know if it uh is still correctly uh We'll see.
Speaker C: How do you wear this thing? Not too many cables and stuff. Original. Uh. Just one thing. Uh, you said twenty-five minutes, but I have something else to do uh, so gotta have another meeting uh soon, so maybe you could hurry up a bit It's true. I have another meeting so if you could uh Yeah. Yeah, for the lawnmower project. Okay. What an original idea. Orangutan. Can I give you the no? But I don't have to say anything. When I'm drawing the orangutan. It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan. Yes. I don't have a red colour. Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I don't have red pen, so Yes. Yes. I know. Wha what is this strange beast? Is it a monster? It's a cat? I thought these things did not exist. Ah yeah Does have a name? Caramel. Ah-ha. Next time I concentrate. He looks like a bong. Okay. Sorry. No. Scary? I I think we will be finished this uh Is it for uh for putting a for logos, no. That's I is there a matter for a new remote control? Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control? Ah this is not defined at all? Ah, okay. Well uh do we sell other stuff? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device, otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us. Yeah. No, I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now. Mm. Something like that, least fits in your hand. Yeah. The basic requirement. Only a buck. Waterproof. Mm. B it seems uh so, but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f And, and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it. That's people they actually do it themselves. I it will look a bulky in that case. Like as an optional thing. Barks. That's that's quite cool, but uh of course we you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right? So i it's just going to add t to the cost. It's cool. I think I like the idea, but I'm not sure about the what you, who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget. Who's Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Good. Uh, so we come back in five minutes? Half an hour.
Speaker D: Okay uh sorry. You have to imagine a little bit um. This Sorry too uh. Is it beautiful? Do you know? It's a cat. Isn't it? Yes yes is it like that. Is it better? Okay. It's my cat. Yeah. The name is Caramel. Yeah. Thank you","Okay so welcome everyone . So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff , then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . First it will be the functional design . Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that . And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board . It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . It's a cat . Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow . So Here the uh financial objective of our project . That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros . Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs . so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side ? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device . And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ? If we don't have so many buttons could be nice . And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box . So . Fit in your hand , yeah . Water-proof as well . Maybe water-proof would be very original . And , and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well . most of the time I I lose my remote control . We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping . Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep . That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve . So i it's just going to add t to the cost . Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer . Okay so try to find that for next meeting . So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed . So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . I think that's all for this point ."
112,"Speaker A: So, hello everyone. We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control. I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov and okay let's begin. So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan, some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting. So um we want to to do a new remote control. It has to be original, trendy and user friendly. Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design, it's conceptual design, and desail detailed design. and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day. Um, so let's try the whiteboard. Um so any of you who want to go. Wow. A rabbit. A rabbit. You want to go? A human ah. Mm I think you're supposed to, yeah. Hmm. Is that a worm? Or Uh yeah Christa Pavlov Mm. Smiling fish. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Next. Let's talk about money. So. Yeah, mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control. We aim to do this profit. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum. 'Kay. So any of you have experience in remote controls? That So that could be a great um application. Remote controls children proof. Mm mm-hmm. Okay. So they have to be waterproof maybe? 'Cause they eat she ate it. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Colourful, yeah mm. No, that's a good idea. Mm mm-mm. Yeah. No, because you think, why not. Mm-hmm. Good idea. Small also? Don't you think No uh, not too much buttons or mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's Okay. So, I think there's So you you think it's better if small than bigger. No, not too small, yeah. Hmm. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. So, some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no. Okay. And too expensive. Mm. Mm-mm. Mm-hmm. Mm mm mm. So adaptable yeah something yeah. Three option. Um. Mm-hmm. Maybe if it's more, if there is a software inside that ask you three Hmm. If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button, three mm possibilities, ye yeah. Mm. Yeah. I change channel like this, m uh I want to go to twenty five, and then to ten, uh-huh mm yeah. Also we can be here yeah, that would be cool. Mm yeah. Mm-mm. Okay. So I think we have full of idea. Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones, make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want. And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do. Um. So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm okay. So. I think that's all. Yeah. See you in thirty minutes.
Speaker B: Oops. Yeah, for favourite animals. It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw. And it's gonna be you'll try to guess. No. Yes, that's a rabbit. That's my favourite one. That's it. Hmm. Wow. No. Wow. That's cobra. No, it just small cobra, yeah. It's co c quite recognisable. Christa Christa. Hmm. Okay. Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer. According to the drawings. Okay. On the international market. Wow. Mm. To eat? Children proof. Hmm. Okay, unbreakable. Uh-huh. Colourful? That's not practical. No. But how gonna okay, just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like Otherwise you will never find it. Cool. Ch Yeah, but without any extremes like n not of this size, not too large. Okay. Yeah, like a palm sized. Just to hold it. No, no screens, it's too complex. And n maybe not too expensive, well it's not my problem, but well okay. But no screens on remote controls. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Adaptable. Alright, good, so how many actions do we need to implement in it? On off? I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a like three mental states, yeah you know what I mean, we can just make it uh controlled by a brain, huh? Mm-hmm. Sh sure, sure. But for standard actions you usually what do you do, you change channels, you adjust volume, and nothing else. Mm-hmm. You do this? I usually just change channels. Uh-huh. Go back button is good. I once had it. Mm-hmm. History. Market Expert. Okay. Thank you everybody.
Speaker C: Wow. Wow. Complex. Huh? A cat. No. Darn. Uh. A what? A r a rabbit, oh oh yeah, where is the carrot? Okay mm-hmm. I am not very good at uh this kind of stuff. My favourite animal is Guess. A human, yay. It's a very complex animal and um yeah. Characteristics of this this animal is dangerous. Ah, a kind of uh snake? Cobra? Exactly. Uh-huh. What about you uh Christa? A fish. A smiling fish. Mm-hmm. So, w whiteboard is working? Good. Next. Yeah, well. Not me. So. Twenty five Euro for a remote control. Okay. 'tis big number. Mm-hmm. Uh yes, we have plenty at home. In fact, my daughter likes l remote controls. To eat? Yeah, mainly, and to break. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Ye ye yeah. So she likes uh buttons which make click, so it has to click. It has to be uh wha baby proof yeah but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh So it has to be very robust. Unbreakable, yeah. Mm-hmm. And uh it has to be nice looking, colourful, maybe colourful, because uh nobody has colourful remote control, they're always black, yeah, but this one could be I dunno, purple or b Yeah, yeah. One colour. Yeah, yeah. Oh like the phones, yeah, it could change colours, yeah. Yeah. Good. Should it be, y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television, then it's the remote control for the the sound system, or for your refrigerator whatever I dunno if it's Or if we should have a targeted re remote control. So colour, robustness, easy to use, size, yeah, size matters, yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. But uh what would be different from this, from the others? I dunno if Yeah, at least the colour would be different. I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place. For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow, I dunno. Too expensive for twelve Euro? Ah. Mm-hmm. I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user. So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right, so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control, if you if you like. I don't know if it makes sense, but Yeah, for instance, mm. Mm. Maybe, if if it's possible, yeah. Yeah. Three buttons you mean? Ah. Mm-hmm, yeah, sure. Yeah, more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time. Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five. And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five. Uh no. Because I'm only using three or four channels but And then back to the one I was before, so there's whichever it was. Yeah. Uh uh we had that in in other countries. Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous. Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions, that becomes more complex, but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls. Yeah maybe it's a Okay. So what does M_E_ means? M_E_ the user requirements? Or that's uh that's for us? Uh that's me. Oh, of course yeah, the user requirement specifications, uh-huh, yeah. Okay. I'll think of that. So? Meeting's over? Great. Thank you.
Speaker D: No. Rabbit. You wa Is the white okay. I guess you can. Yeah uh not really. Small cobra. Chris. Mm. Smile fish. Yeah. Yeah, you're Hmm. Yeah, we're to sell two million then. Mm yeah. Yeah, pret Yeah. Ah. Yeah, we have some child lock or something, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's always black or yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah even we can change colours, no? Like the uh like the phones and these things we c yeah. At least for children like one colour and. And it should be really small and. Huh not so big like yeah. Yeah, not too much buttons and Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Colour, size, sh Yeah, maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess. Yeah yeah, at least it should hold in your hand n properly, like. Yeah. Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame. Mm. S so then it depends you are to Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Too expensive, yeah. Ye yeah. Hmm. I mean it it's like it's like two types no? people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this, say if you're right handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on yeah. Mm huh. Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working. We can adapt only one switch, suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations. Two. Yeah. Yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit. Dash. Yeah you can yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah, the previous button is. Uh, okay. Oh uh. Uh. Yeah. Yeah yeah, what the which channels the viewer Marketing yeah.

111,"Speaker A: I feel like Madonna with one of these on. I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on. Right. Hello everybody. Back again for another wonderful meeting. Is uh everyone ready? Okay, we c we can hold on for a minute. I figured with the spam thing, if you can't beat it, join in. Are you ready? Okay, right, well, I take it that you are all ready now. Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting. Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing, and who we all are and stuff like that, mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on. Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing, now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that, that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before, see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today. Um yeah, we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations, whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want. Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first. I want what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and It's just that yeah, let's let's hear from you first. Get yourself in position. I don't think any of us remember the fifties. Do sol solar panel things, do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb? Does anybody know? Okay. Mm. Okay, jolly good. What's a double curved one? Okay. So that might be an idea of using the rubber, but then it should, you know yeah. when a T_V_ programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost, you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you. Yeah, I like that idea. Rubber, we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea? You think you can market that? Ooh, we like rubber, ooh. Uh-huh. Well, we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so push buttons instead of the wheel? rubble double double. I'll have a Big Mac, please. Let's have rubber push buttons, hey. Yeah. Simple, yeah. Chip on print. It's a bit. Okay, uh what I'm not understanding here is uh, okay, advanced chip on print, which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender? Right. Um what a what alternatives do we have to that? Y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print? so it sounds So, why would we not go for that? If it's something that's inside the the unit. I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not. Um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works, you know. So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print. Yeah. S yeah, push buttons. What about what? Well, what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit? S Yeah. It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Basic battery. It's cheap, it's cheerful, it's worked, does work. We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber, weren't we? The the The double whopper, please. Yep, but we're going for the simple buttons. Yeah. And it's cheapest all round, it sounds kinda funky, and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_, and this is anti-R_S_I_. So that's another marketing point that we can use. But anything is gonna have buttons. Even if it's a jog wheel, it's still repetitive. You You see, you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury, whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen. It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement. It's not actually what you are doing. But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific Yeah. And you know, yeah, you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah. Okay, Gabriel. Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface. Great. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do we have an uh example of a good one? Brilliant. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well let's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team? The um The the um the interface type we're going for Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, and we're not yeah. Are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything, you know, colours or particular gimmicky bits to it, we're not we're just gonna go for something We're Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okey-dokey. Yeah, I don't have any other questions on this. Let's move over to Yeah, sure.. Yeah, the button that just does that, yeah. Cool. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_? What's that mean? Okay, now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already, that's cheap. Yeah. Maybe we could um Of course, they do. One hundred per cent, that's your first thing, you go, oh I'm not gonna buy that, 'cause I dunno if it works or not. Okay, well, what do you two think about this? Yeah, what I don't understand what m Yeah, and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television. It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it, which no no television does, does it? That would mean we'd have to make a television as well. No, that would be your telephone in with your television. Yeah, and i Nah, the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible, basically. An and there is no there is no such thing. Okay. Okay. Yeah, this that's that's very good. And and this is all tying in very nicely. The fact that it's made out of this rubber, we can throw it about. Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about, because it charges itself up by doing it. But yeah, by the squeezing it the Yeah, that's a great idea. Well done. Yeah. I wanna watch the pineapple channel. Well spongy, that's where. Yeah, we're we're ahead of the game there. Okay. Alright, yeah, no, this i this is good, so through all that we've we go we're right, we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing, that's great, using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself, you are charging the batteries, and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though.. Yeah, this is true. Well, okay, it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image. Like, yeah, we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables, but we dunno what it should be, or like are we going yeah it looks slick, but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing? I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky. L keep it clean, keep it clean. Bright, but not too bright. Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that, do you mean? Okay, what? Okay. Tha Yeah, I mean we that's we we Yeah. This is the remote control tomato. Yeah. Well, it's it's gotta be chew proof. So, what are you saying, maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range, the blue range, the green range, the Mm. Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know, if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular. Mm. Okay. Alright. Well um, we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design. Um Gabriel, you're gonna be working on, you know come up with the the user interface design. Then basically, you two are gonna be working together on this. You won't be going off to your separate offices. Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay. I think, yeah, it's gonna you know, come up ki you know, be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas. 'Cause at the moment, uh you know, it's it's hard. We were kinda going, yeah, it's gotta feel nice, it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start, you know, s some sort of physical something or other. Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation. Um. And I will be uh talking to the bosses, basically, and uh f fielding off some more spam and uh that's it really. Keeping things t well, uh you know, ho hopefully uh keeping things together. Um. Yeah, that's This is this is uh good. So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on. We definitely know how it's powered, we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons, we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things, so we've we're keeping the costs down. It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky. Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff. People, you know, people are saying, oh, standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury, well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite, It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it. Um. you know, we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it, you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have? We'll look into this lock key facility, although whether or not it happens, or is possible, I don't know, but something to look into. Okay. I think that's um well done everybody. Anyone have any uh any questions, everyone know what they're doing? 'Cause if you don't, you'll I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it. Okay. right well. It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish. But um I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just hold hold fire. Um. Um I think, it's uh, yeah, I think, it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product. Yeah, I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. I want a share in the space rocket. Did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship. Yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. Mm. And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it but I still want one. Okay. Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying, finish the meeting. Uh. Yeah. Yeah. It's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet. So maybe you should go back to your own offices. Yeah. Yeah, it says you two
Speaker B: . Almost. Mm 'kay. No no no no, it's fine I'm just preparing. Okay. Where is that thing? Oh sorry, couldn't see. Would that work? Okay, so that's me again. Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery, a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches, if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah, yeah. It wouldn't be very fancy. You can have a kinetic provision of energy, which is used on some watches these days. So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work. Or you can use solar cells, but I'm not sure about that indoors, really, but Yeah. I dunno actually. I dunno. Um. Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery, really. And uh if we want something fancier, I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice, but I don't know if it's worth the cost. So we've got to discuss that. For the case of the remotes itself, um they can be a general case, which is just a flat one. You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one, if you know what I mean, so You know, kind of more ergonomic, that kind of suits the palm of your hand, that kind of thing. So Um then the case material itself, so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex, uh rubber, wood, or titanium. And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium, you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case, we can't choose titanium. And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material, so we just have to take that into account. But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything. And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing, so we could uh Yeah. Yeah. And also it doesn't break as easily maybe, I dunno So rubber would be Okay. Uh s so if d okay. And then there are the push-buttons, so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels, like you have on a mouse, um or you could have um L_C_D_, which gives you a display. Um scroll buttons, as well. So if you use a rubber double curved case, you must use rubber push-buttons. So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case. Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons. So it's a constraint. Yeah, but is it a double curved one or not? If it's not a double curved, then we've got the choice for the push-buttons, if it's a double curve, we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons. If that makes sense. Yeah.. No, but na le you see, you've got, okay, the energy that's one thing, then you have the case is uh, whether it's flat or curved. And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not, but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material. So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat, single curved or double curved. And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why, but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons. So, either I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case. Let's go crazy. And then, do I have a last slide? Yes, I do. Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons. Um and the price that go with it with it, so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest. Uh if we get a scroll-wheel, that's a higher price range. If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_, the display thing, then that's even more expensive. Mm.. Yeah. The infra-red. Yeah. Well, if if it's not chip on print then, I guess, you get different chip components, and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red. It's less expensive mm Technically speaking, it's not as advanced, but it does the job, too. Fo It doesn't, yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Yeah. So let's not go for the Yeah, yeah. I agree. So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons. Well It'd be it'd be cool, but they are saying they've just developed it, I'm just guessing. But it's gonna be the most expensive option, probably and Hm. Just if you are really lonely, maybe. Channel five. And then it switches on. Okay, so I'll go back, maybe, to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem, what we should choose. So for the energy source, do we go for the battery or the Cheaper option. Are you happy with that? Okay. So we'll go for the battery. Then the case, do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved? Double? Okay, so then if we use double curved case, then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons, and that's fine? P Yeah. I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a That they don't. Mm. Alright, that's me done. Sorry. Well Bluetooth would, for example, enable you, I think, to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone, but your mobile phone is downstairs or something, you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now. Things like that. No i No, but if you get Bluetooth on the remote, you'd be able to I with the television, yeah. I was just trying to find an advantage. Wha what w what advantage would you get for the Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then. It's been done for watches, but I haven't seen that for remotes, yet. Change the batteries ever again. Yeah, well, and in little characters you say, yeah, but not too much. Yep. No vegetables. Well yeah, but Apple would sue you for that. sued the Beatles so Yeah. Why not? I'm gonna write that down. That's yeah. Although I'd be curious to see how many uh You know, there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose, and I would be curious how many people choose that colour. Mm. And produce less of the silly colours, maybe. Yep. Alright. Mm. Cool. It is. Great. That's true. Doesn't Yeah. Are we taking these off?
Speaker C: Hello. Yeah. That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive. Hmm. Do you have any preference uh of order? I think she is still finishing her. Hmm. Okay, it's uh Is it like a crank thing or something. Well, there's sometimes combinations, I mean, like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power. Uh I think, it has to be on the on the solar energy, but I don't know. Let's have a squeezable remote. If it's rubber, isn't it malleable anyway, it doesn't matter if it's double I mean isn't a rubber case, mean it's completely flexed, I mean, it it flexes to whatever they want it to? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case? Okay. Okay. Go rubber. Go rubber the whole way. I think push-buttons is Yeah. Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh, 'cause uh The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine, where, basically, you can program a sample wi um That when you say something it will give a response, and you program the response as well. Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself. So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say, good morning, to it it says, hello Rick, or whatever. But, I mean, it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like, turn the T_V_ on, and i turns comes on, but it's not that. It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response. So, yeah, I mean, like what's the point of saying, Hello remote, I mean, hello, how how are you? Yeah, if you're really lonely, it is it's No, tha that w that w that would be more promising. It it's just a remote that talks to you. Uh. I mean to certain cues. 'Kay. Yeah, I'm fine with the basic battery. Hmm. Yeah, so we want it rub rubber double curved. So rubber rubber keys, yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. We're giving them a way to burn off steam, basically, yeah. Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful. Oh yeah, I guess T_V_ can be stressful, yeah, if you're watching sports. Alright. Alright. Yeah, some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about. Okay, so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic. And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division. It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them. Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um, 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out. Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products, uh like the coffee machine. So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface. I guess, we we basically vetoed that idea. It's it's pointless. Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output. It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_. Uh so yeah, they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod. Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing. Um the other suggestion, and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general, but they suggested uh, you know, going i a little bit into a a niche, like either gearing our remote towards kids, where you could have lot of colours um, the keys might be you know, funny or or, or uh something for the elderly, where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons. But you know we can we can discuss this, but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general, but done well. Uh um So, the key layout and design are really crucial. You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um. And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of uh, good layout and bad layout uh from our manufacturing department. So this would be an example of bad layout, where you have volume up and volume down, but they have a V_ on both of them, so uh it's sort of confusing for the user. Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose. And for something for kids. Yeah. Um. And so, yeah, I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um. Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense. I think it should be more general. I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us. And, yeah, that's it for me. So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh. So, yeah, it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons. Um. I think we shall have a limited number of buttons, ideally, I mean a a power, channel up, channel down, volume up, volume down, and a numerical keypad. Uh. And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that. I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that. Well now that we've decided on our Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy, but um Yeah, I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere, like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow, or something like that. I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before. I mean, 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button. But I think that should be I mean um, I can speak with the button department, but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating. So that should be simple. Mm. Yeah. Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense, I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I mean, these first two points we've already sort of gone away from, 'cause our rubber one is not fancy I mean it's different, but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy. If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction. And it's it's not technologically innovative either. Mm. So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other electronics? Yeah, that's basically what it allows you to do, right? Yeah, the that wouldn't be the remote so much, I mean Mm. Yes, so can Yeah, we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator. we're all about that. Okay, so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them.. Yeah, that's great for us. Right. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, I don't know how we incorporate We don't have to follow every trend, I guess. Uh-huh. The power button could be like a big apple or something. They don they don't own all images of apples. Okay, we'll make it a uh pomegranate, a big pomegranate.. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Sure. The one thing I'm wondering about, I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes, and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote. I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take? Mm. Yeah I mean, that that seems to work well with for products like iPod, where, you know, you have a variety of colours, that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it, even, you know, just just by the fact of choosing. Right. Yeah. Okay. Oh right. Yeah. That sounds good. Mm. Right. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Mm, I think we all know what we need to do now. Okay. Okay, I'll stay in here. Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check, or is that So we're buying fut I mean, we're getting futures in the company. So we really have a incentive to make this remote work. I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits, because that's really doing well. Yeah.. This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots. Yeah, we're definitely not in the money making department. Well I I did notice looking at I mean, they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable. I mean, if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page, it's not obvious. R_R_. Well it is to us, because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine, but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black. No. Mm. Okay. Right, well, I guess that's us. Okay. Right.
Speaker D: Oh right okay. I cover myself up.. I've always wanted one of these, I really have. Where do you buy 'em from? They're. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Mm-hmm. Batteries. It's here. Ah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. I think rubber's But after my after my fashion thing, I think you'll realise that rubber is more People. What about the just developed uh sample sensor? G there, the sample sensor, sample speaker thing. Mm, I dunno. Be cool. Channel two. Oh, it just gives an answer. Oh, then then I thought I thought it was when they said I thought when they said, voice recognition, they meant um like, channel five, and it will change. Like you talk to it. Can I have channel five? Oh, then forget about it. Oh right okay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. So it will look like something like this.. Yeah. Well the rubber push-buttons. Don't you have to move your Mm. Mm. Yeah, the rubber's good. Yeah, so they can sit there and go like Mm. Mm. That does get annoying. Uh-huh. Well Maybe we can Right. Well, I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year. Um. So yes, so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market, we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed. Um the most important aspect is look and feel. So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have. So it has to be Yep. Exactly. Um second, uh it should be technologically innovative innovative. So Technologically it should be like um work, basically, I guess. It should work. Should That's new. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. So, no loose That's why I was thinking, Bluetooth, 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth, and it's like a Bluetooth remote control, everybody's gonna like, oh, 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays, like it really is, like people and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for, they don't really care whether, you know, at the end of the day whether it works properly or not. Well, they do, but it's like it's not Yeah, but it looks good. If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration. But like You could always insert, yeah. Yeah, but, I mean, people like Well, if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people, you have to make it new, you have to make it state of the art. Well, it doesn't Like it doesn't have to be, you know, Bluetooth, that was just an idea, but like it needs do something that, you know, is new. Whether it's a battery it could be something really really minor, you know, like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there, and people've already seen it, people've already got it. If we want something new, we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative. And then you can market it. Never have to change a battery again. I think, safety s Yeah. Third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use. And I think we've all um worked that out. Um okay, in the fashion, how it's supposed to look. Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths, shoes and furniture. So next year people will be buying, I found this really funny, you know, strawberry shaped chairs, and things. Yeah. Rubber things. Um and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy, so it's it's not quite spongy, but spongy, I would say is yeah, so we're in. Yeah. And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel, while still keeping to the company's image, basically. So yeah.. I had to say So we're moving in the right direction like Mm. Maybe make it like fruity colours or something. Some sort. Or Mm. Well I think, if it's rubber it needs to be different. I think, it's it should be I mean, what do you associate with rubber? You know like really different colours basically. Okay, sor I sorry, I used the wrong word, what do you associate with the mate the material that material? Um Um like I'm just thinking bright colours. Bright natural colours, nothing too Bright, but too not yeah. Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink. Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like Yeah. And on the back of it have the logo. Well I can say in this country, you'll get, you know, lots of people wanting something really funky and cool. Like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying, Mummy I wanna buy that one. And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well, because it's um like kids won't break it, it's not breakable if you throw it around. Especially with younger kids, you know they can pick it up and and Yeah. The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it, but Yeah. So so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families, like like family use as well, so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it, I think. Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something. Yeah. So like you walk in, you're like, oh I like that remote control, because it's so bright, and then, and then the shop assistant comes up and says, oh what colour would you like? and then they go like, oh I can choose the colour wow. So it puts, I think, even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of, you've got all colour it's either that or nothing. So they also get to pick. Well, personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour. It's um Yeah. Mm. D you've got the Evaluation. Mm. Yeah. S This gives you all the details? um. Yeah. Mm. Mm.","The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The industrial designer discussed different options for batteries, materials, and components, as well as restrictions involved in combining particular materials, components, and batteries. The team then discussed and decided what materials, components, and what type of battery to use in their product. The interface specialist presented examples of existing remotes on the market with good and bad layouts and stated what features the remote required. The marketing expert discussed research from trendwatching reports, finding that products now require technological innovativeness, a fancy look and feel, a spongy feel, and a fruit and vegetable theme. This lead to a discussion on whether to use Bluetooth or infra-red technology in remote. The team then discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the remote."

Six. Six. Six six six point five. Yeah, seven. Easy to find. I lost my banana. Uh. Six. Yeah, okay. Uh f yeah, it's ru it's rubber. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Six or five. Five. Six. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare. Start to eat banana. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Fruits.
Speaker B: It is a banana. It is the essence of bananas. I would be confused with this thing. S How is everyone? Mm-hmm. Like a banana. I give it a I give it a five. And you? Do you vote uh Christine? Do you also vote? Well, we can very easily. I So it will have five point five average. Mm. It's four. Yeah. D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not? Huh? No. Okay. Yeah. For twenty five. Yeah. I give a seven, I think. 'Kay. Yeah, we can we can put a seven here. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we hope. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's cool. I think we can put a six here. So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely, or Yeah. Yeah the only problem there might be which know, i if it's very sensitive, they will, I don't know Yeah, okay. Mm. Six, yeah, for me. Yeah. Twenty. Thirty. Thir Okay. Yeah, the top Mm. So will become eight soon? Yeah, well it's a bit biased. Okay. Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped, uh wireless phones not mobile ones, wireless for the house, uh quite big also, and they were selling something like a hundred Euros, two hundred Euros. Just a just a phone, wireless. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's much more complex, but Okay. Congratulations to the team. Uh very well, we worked together fantastically. So what does the management say? What does the management say? Ah. Yeah. Okay. Mm.
Speaker C: Okay. Je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype. It really looks like a banana. It is a banana. Mm. Okay. Hi. So we are here for the detailed design meeting. So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting. Then uh I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual. We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work. And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product. Then we will uh evaluate the product. And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not. So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time, that is to say uh to have a standard battery, to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy, and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera. And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros. So which is uh good, because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros. So for the financial aspect it's okay, we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if, and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert. Yeah. You have a presentation? Participant four, yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Maybe you can presen okay. Maybe hold it. So I think it's uh very uh very nice. What do you think? Yeah. So it's between one and seven? Seven is the highest uh? I will give a six. Maybe we all have to agree on a common Yeah. No problem. So this is your One is most. Well, we can choose what we want. Okay, let's say that seven is the best. Okay. So so do note the grade we have five, six for me, five. And what what's your choice? How much would you give on the fancy aspect, on the fashionable aspect? How much would you you don't answer to this uh questionnaire? Five point five average. Okay. Well, does it Okay, techne technological aspect. Yeah, we have the wheel. We also have the rubber material, which make it uh like new also. I think I would give a five. Four? Okay. No. So what's your uh grade? Four? So we have four, four f and five? Yeah, four. Four, yeah, let's put four. Doesn't it Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I would give a I would give a seven as well. It's very easy to use. So six point five. Okay. Oh yeah, its its f its fruit fruit shape. I would say seven. And is very very nice design. Yeah. Seven, okay. I think you can't miss it. Okay. Yeah, we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but So it's yellow. It's okay. I think it's very easy to I would say seven. It's hard to miss it. Yeah, it's rubber, made of rubber, I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control. Yeah. But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material. So maybe we can put a six. Six is okay? Yeah. Tadada. We have to sum up everything. Six is a good Yeah, the be. Okay, so six is a So it's a good evaluation, I think. It's very promising. Huh. So this prototype is quite nice. Yeah. Okay. So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive, I think. I think the Yeah. So, I think, we can summarise. So we have seen the prototype. It's very nice according to the work of our two designer. The the the financial aspect were okay. We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit. The the evaluation give satisfying result as well. So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting. So the cost is in the budget, the evaluation is okay, so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party. I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff. Okay so congratulation. Nice product. Yeah. I think it was a good collaboration uh. Aspect. Sorry? I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well. All it depends on who watch this meeting. We don't know. Okay, so good guys, so see you for next uh successful project.
Speaker D: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. So uh you can have my project in Uh yeah just a Four. Evaluation. Okay. So you can go. We can go through. So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings. So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points. We we talked about before. So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel, technologically innovative, easy to use, fashion, easy to find in a room, and robust, uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points. Okay. So I go through all the uh all the points here, and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point, two point or seven point. Okay? And after we ha we have an an average, and uh we see. The okay? Uh so uh fancy look and feel, what do you think? F between o one and seven. Yeah. Seven is the Mm-hmm. sorry. eh? No, I just want to see something Mm-hmm. Uh I think uh and need to as well. Need to uh I don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or Uh-uh. Um. Yeah. Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm. Oh sorry. Six Uh s you can how much what? Oh yes I mm I dunno mm, I think six, it's a good uh Yeah. Wa can. Okay. I sorry. Okay. So after, the technological aspect? So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel. Uh. No. Four. We can put four? Everyone is okay or four poin Four. Okay. Very easy to use. Do you think it's easy to use? Mm, six for me also. Six point five. Okay. Is it fashion? Seven? Yeah it's fashion, because it's a fruit, and we say that the yeah, seven. Uh easy to find in a room? Yeah? We have the lightning, or The lighting. Yeah. Seven? Is it is it robust? Everybody is okay, six. Yeah. Okay. S now um so. Thirteen uh, twenty, twenty six point five, uh seven, thirty two, thirty six. That's that's okay? Six. Good. Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better, and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product, I think. We have a good price and uh. Good. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay.",The Project Manager presented the final cost of the remote with the finalized list of components. The final cost was under the alotted budget; the Project Manager announced that the project could then continue with the current prototype. The Marketing Expert presented an evaluation of the prototype to the group. The group evaluated the prototype based on the requirements of users presented in the first meetings. The group decided that the prototype met enough of these goals to be able to market the product. The prototype was presented and the group discussed the look of the prototype. The Project Manager summarized the accomplishments of the meeting.

Okay, and then F_ five, right? Okay. Um okay, so the interface concept um. Yeah. The interface specification, what people um how they interact with it basically, I think. Um so the method, we looked at existing designs, what are the what's good about them, what's bad about them, um I looked at their flaws, so we're going to look at their flaws, everything. Um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good, so a bit of imagination. Uh the findings, I've got some pictures to show you as well. Yeah. Okay, so most remote controls use graphical interface, where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something. Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout, which makes it confusing. So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls, but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something, I think, people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use. And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you. Do I press Escape F_ five? Or just Escape, okay. Um, oh I still haven't got my glasses on. Yeah, okay. So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones. I'll just walk you through them. This one is a voice recognition. And that's the kind of idea we're going for. There's um an L_C_D_ thing, which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us. This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse, which Yeah. Um and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that, like would the computer come Uh-huh, that's like the L_C_D_ one, is it? But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side. But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen. I think that's what that is. So these are just a few ideas. Again that's just quite boring shape, grey, looks quite space-agey, but too many buttons, I think on that one. Yeah, it does look kind of dangerous. Um this one I thought was really cool. It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about. You can put it in there, it's for your kids, and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool. And that's really easy to use, bright, so I like this one lot for our design. I think something like that would be good. Of course yellow. Right, yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something. And this one, the over-sized one, I don't know about you, but I think it's a bit too gimmicky. I don't think that will sell very well. I guess so. I don't know. I think that's a bit Yeah exactly. Yeah. And um this one is just pointing out. I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything, but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down, but it would actually go up, because of the shape. So that could that's a bit confusing. Um but the buttons on this I think are it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons. They don't have to be all the same. So that's quite cool. Um. Yeah, exactly. Um F_ five. Yes. So there are some of the findings. So we need to combine those ones um and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in. Um yeah it is, just in time, very handy. Um so I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good. It's you program it like you say, record, um and then, play, and then, record, play machine, and stuff like that, so that's And it's much Yeah. So that's quite cool. Uh personal preferences just some imagination, the raised symbols I thought were good, the L_C_D_, it does look smart, but I think maybe for our budget, do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the Yeah. And the speech recognition, 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition, are we? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But our budget, we've Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay. I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost,. The L_C_D_. Yeah. No. Yeah. S Uh-huh. Yeah, that's the thing, because Yeah. That's true, yeah. And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use, so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_. It's a it's great, it's a good idea, but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use, it's not the thing we should go for, I think. Child-friendly, I thought this was good, as you pointed out the um the bit, it often goes missing especially with children, but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape, I think. Yeah, I know, carrot. Yeah. But we don't want it to be Yeah. Um the child-friendly, yeah. Easy to use, it seems quite easy to use. I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff. I think that's a good idea to go for. Yeah. And the mouse one, I thought it was a good idea, because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing. Um. Yeah. S yeah. So they'd be able to use that um, as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen. Um so there you go. Yeah. So that's um the user interface design. So okay, I'll take this out now then. There you go. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. I'm not sure about the sponge. Yeah. Yeah. I like the rubber, the stress balls, I think, you know, that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and Yeah. And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around. Yeah, y yellow incorporated, yeah. I think Mm. Yeah, the buttons w like, 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if we're having buttons actually, I don Yeah. You do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red, and stuff like that, yeah. Makes it easy to use. Yeah, that's true, because that blue one did look quite hardish. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Like uh an hour glass kind of figure, is that what you're thinking of, or just like a It's not Yeah. We could make novelty remote controls. Yeah. But then how would you point it? How would you point it? What Yeah. y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea. Rubber banana. Okay. Yeah. I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape. And what else did you say about fashions? What was trendy? And spongy, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe, yeah. Like what's what's that, I don't even know the name of it, some kind of, you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing. I don't know the name of that. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Yeah, maybe that's what they are. 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and Yeah. I don't know. What do you guy What do you think? No. Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. And buttons would, did we say? Uh different shapes of buttons? Mm. Yeah. Yeah, what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm not sure. Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration, I think. Um yeah, I can no I'm not sure. I couldn Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. So let's not use the whiteboard any more. And uh so what else was there? Um the What about the glow-in-the-dark thing, the strip around it? Are we just gonna leave that? You still like it. 'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system. 'Cause um it could Yeah. Especially with yellow. Mm. I dunno. Then you put it in the fruit bowl? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, do we need buttons? Mm. I quite like the shape. I quite like the design of that, uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base. Um and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, 'cause you said about disposable, didn't you? You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that, like have a choice. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. We still need the buttons in the same places thought, don't we? Oh, that's the other side. Oh, okay. Oh, half a fruit. Oh, okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Mm mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well, um because Well, I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing, because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what Yeah, w I think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five, thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said. They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick, but something ergonomically shaped and organic, like good to hold, based on fruits and natural things like that, because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow, you know. I mean we could make it nice pale yellow. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with, you said, the logan the slogan. Because Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, a d a dynamo? Yeah. Yeah, like with those watches that you kind of twist. Yeah that's quite cool. Yeah, it is, yeah. Yeah, then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah. That's true. But w like just normal light? And we're a very environmentally friendly company, aren't we as well? Yeah. Yeah. Like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Just in time. Yeah, mine seems to have turned off. I can't do anything. No. It's on, but there's nothing on the screen. Cool. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Yeah. I think, I've saved mine already. Cool. Fun. Yeah. Star fruit. No. Oh yeah, we can do buttons. No I'm good. Okay. Mm.
Speaker B: No. We should make a big sponge lemon, and then it'd be it would be yellow. It's Yeah. Mm. No, it's got it's got it. Wow. Uh it looks threatening. It looks like yeah. Wow. Then d blind don't watch T_V_. They do? The L_C_D_ and the other stuff uh, I think. Ben bana Hmm. But uh price price not withstanding um, is it too complicated, is it gonna be too much just overload? But but the thing is when you use a remote control, you never look at it, right? You're looking at the T_V_ and and it's uh It just seems kind of like a a needless th So which vegetable? Okay. The the lemon. Well what are the options? Oh. Okay. Um so I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among, and I'll I'll give you the uh, I guess, technical considerations for those. And I'm gonna use the whiteboard, just 'cause we haven't used it. Right. So, the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls, see how they work, uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it, and then we'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget. So uh yeah, looking inside a a very simple remote control. Um this is what they sent me. 'Kay. Here's uh the competition, I suppose. Um you open it up, there's a circuit board inside, um and there's a a chip, a processor, the T_A_ one one eight three five, which um receives input from the buttons, and ch Right, it's very they're very cheap remote. This remote costs nothing, you know. Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier, which is made of some transistors and amplifiers, op-amps, and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light, which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end, and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television. Oh here it is. Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control, because it it defines the uh R Um no, I mean this is a very old one, so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make. Right. So this is what we need to have for certain. Um. So you know, as we said, we got the outer casing, which we have to decide, you know, what's it gonna be, um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up, processor, um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had, amplifier and transmitter are all standard. Um so for the casing, uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh, you know, we have a bunch of options from wood, titanium, rubber, plastic, whatnot, um latex, double-curved, curved. So lots of choices, what do we think? Uh or sponge, I guess, isn't on there, right. Organic sponge. Uh yeah, it's very elasticy for sure. Um. Yeah so Okay so, here are a a plastic, uh latex Oh right. So something with give to it. Okay. And and the colour is yellow, right? Yellow, okay. Um. Mm' kay. So yellow for the body, and then what colour for the buttons? So multi-coloured buttons. Okay. Okay. Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go Um how exactly? Maybe double What about a banana? Yeah? Okay, like we could have a big banana shaped remote control, 'cause it's yellow fruit, right? Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point, I guess. We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end. So a spongy banana re Yeah. Okay, okay. See So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric. So it'd look like this kinda. Like a gourd almost, or a squash of some sort? Yeah, and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say, you know, it transmits from this end. Yeah. Okay, so double-curved, single-curved, what do we feel? Okay. Okay um, I guess, since you're the marketing guy. We'll uh Okay, we could do that. Um. Okay, so so buttons. Okay, just like that. Okay. With the scroll-wheel or no? Okay uh I could put the microphone here. Okay there's the microphone. Where should I put the microphone? Okay, well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels, right? Okay. Okay. So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or 'Kay there's the mic. Um n well we can Whoops. Um. Yeah. Um. Oops, sorry. Okay. Right. Hmm. They can work from a You don't have to hold it. Yeah. I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers, you know they have uh fruits all round them. Now just make sure they don't eat the remote. Yeah. Okay. But yeah But yeah, about the speech thing, it doesn't have to be hand held or close. It can sit at a distance and pick it up still. Yeah yeah. Okay, um so Yeah, s I guess we decided on material, right? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel, and the colours we got down, and the shape, maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or Yeah. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Great. Um as for the energy source um, you know, almost every remote control uses just batteries, but we don't have to be limited by that. We can use a hand-dynamo. Um I don't know what that means, we crank it? Right, it's like those watches that you c So, this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab, you can shake it if it's out of power. Okay. So if it if it's not working, I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing. Right. Okay. Uh there's solar power. Um. Yeah. Okay, so probably just Mm. 'Kay. Okay. So uh a rechargeable battery. Okay. Um the user interface, the buttons, I guess we talked about this already. Um. Hmm? Uh th the uh the electronics um, basically the more features we add um Oops, this one. So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in, which adds to the cost as you can expect. Um. But uh I think we can keep it all under budget. So uh yes, so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through. So just in time. Right, right. Yeah, and keeping the L_C_D_ screen out. Huh? Oh yeah that was that was it. So control F_ eight, right? Try uh flipping the screen down. 'Kay. Oh, I get to do it, too. Oh neat. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Save everything to the shared documents, is that right? Oh. Uh these lapel mics are trouble. Are we done with our meeting? Yeah.
Speaker C: Yeah. Hi, me Raj, again. Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching, uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this. So we have to look on this. First of all methodology. The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey, but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market, because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit. So what are our findings? In our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good, rather than having a functional look and feel uh good. So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls. So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor, because this factor is twice as important, the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor. So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls. No the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile, the it should have a fancy outlook, the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good, it should have a fancy look and foo feel good. The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative. We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are. So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition, something like that. So that indicates our technological advancement. And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use, like it shouldn't be too much co complicated, there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control, it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way. And it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language, something. So that they could know how to use these remote controls. When we did uh f fashions uh, recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that Ah yeah? Y yeah uh yeah, we have to, because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes, shoes, and everything with fruits and vegetables, because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic, becoming more and more organic, becoming Yeah. So Yeah. So something like that we we should do. And people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look, hard look. Yeah. Yeah. So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it. So that should also be taken into consideration. So these are my views. So No it ca y a The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co Yeah. 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also, because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration, so we don't want to have any harm to the society, so So that's all. S uh we didn't find out any such point. Uh yes, there could be, but we couldn't find out any, so Yeah. Oh no,. Yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more, but they want the quality, they want f fancy look, they want some new design, something new. Uh yeah. Yeah. So even if we increase our cost little bit, within uh some limits, and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook, I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market. And the Uh i it will be easy because there will be, on L_C_D_ s screen, there will be different frent icons, they can just click ok okay, whatever they wa Ah yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I appreciate this idea, because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables, the people's choices. That what our data shows that, so this w this w Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables, like people uh now Spongy. Yeah, then only we can relate it with something. Yeah. Exactly. Or we can do something, we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey, let the public choose what they want. Yeah, sure. I will be happy to do that. Yeah. Or we can we can do one thing, we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes, different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece. So whatever people want, like if somebody want it in banana shape, we will put that casing onto that mobile phone, okay, it will look l Uh yeah. In that w S s sorry? Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of, we need not to have a full cover, we will just have a half of cover, okay? If somebody wants it i in banana shape, we will fit banana shape casing onto that, so it will give a banana shape look. If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that, we will put we will put apple shape casing on that. It will give apple shape look. So in that way you can have any, that means whatever you want, without uh yeah. Yeah, button will be on the upper side, buttons will be the on the upper side. Yeah, buttons will be on the upper side, lower side we will just put the casing, so half of that will be look the Yeah, not not the upper side. So from lower you can, it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look, whatever. So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything, we will just design casings fruit shape. And Yeah,. But But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo, tha these type of cells? Because then people have to, well like if the cell is out of bat Yeah, to mo Yeah. Yeah, because most of the people Yeah. Uh, solar power will w also not be a good idea, because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy, and the days when there is no sola sunlight Yeah. Yeah. What we w yeah. I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea. They can they can recharge it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Uh excuse me, Bri You just touch the pad, yeah. No? That's great. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh it was under a different name. I will show you, in shared documents. Uh working components. Oh, you didn't get that. I will send new. Uh I'll put it in shared documents, again. Project documents, sorry, I put it in the shared documents. Uh yeah. Right, that's great. But I cou can't open that, because it w asks uh for some username or password. I'll show you. Ts Sorry. Uh. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, th thank you. Oh sorry. Uh excuse me, Brian. You have to keep your pen separate, because I used your pen. S Hmm. Hmm. So sh should Should we leave now, Brian? Or we are going to discuss something? Yeah. Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you. Yeah. So.
Speaker D: Um we are So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time. So switching over I've just left uh my first two screens. Um I have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time. Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you? N No? Okay, cool. Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj. Alright, okay. Fashion. Mm 'kay. Fruit and veg, well there you go. Just what I think of when I think of a remote control. Mm-mm-mm-mm. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. Function F_ eight. Hmm. Excuse me. Uh, yeah. Mm 'kay. either. Uh okay. Right, okay. Yeah. Excellent. Uh no just escape should uh 'Kay. Looks pretty complicated. Right, okay. Mm-hmm, like the middle button. Okay. Ah it's kinda like scrolling uh right, well, if I s if I'm thinking of the right one, I've got the same thing in front of my monitor, you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require, you press the middle of the scroll. Right, okay. Yeah, presumably. Yeah, looks like uh looks like something out of a jet. Okay. Yeah, I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um, I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing. So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever. Yeah. I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something, is it? Strange. No they do, they do. They listen to it. Yeah. Right, okay. 'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway, don't they? Brilliant. That's handy. Okay. Okay. It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty, you know. Okay. Yeah. I can't see tha Although, th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now, so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small But I mean like I I the black and white, I guess, it just doesn't look funky enough. Um but, I mean, like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens, w I ju I mean I wouldn't know about the costs of them. Twelve fifty. Possibly. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well I mean we could make a Yeah. Well, si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours, I think your lemon wasn't that far s And if it doesn't work you know, we've just made a lemon. Mm-hmm. I like I like the colourful buttons as well. Yeah. I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five, so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use. Yeah. And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker, so 'Kay. Yeah, looks like it. Uh Yeah, I was just thinking the self same thing. Magic man. Mm-hmm. So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip, is it? Right. Okay. So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or? They gotta be Almost a key-ring. Okay. 'Kay. Well. Well, I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it, doesn't it. Um Yeah. And that would k also give it kinda durability and and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast. Um so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath? Oh right, okay. I don't know what that stuff is. Yeah. Or at least incorporating, yeah. I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh I don't know what other standard silver kind of Other parts or uh Mm-hmm. Um. Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself. Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish, perhaps. Yeah. Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well. I mean if we are gonna make it a novel I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use, a bit comfier, you know. Yeah it's uh, yeah, that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold, easy to hold so you don't drop it. Well, yeah, I mean like Yeah, yeah. Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip. Yeah. They only cost pennies. Huh? Um. I mean that that th does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe. S And sponginess. Huh. Uh. Yeah, why the hell not. Let's that'll make us fifty million Euros. Um. Well, I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape, yeah? Yeah, we can relate it by advertising or Yeah. There's a good man. There's a good idea. Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions, you know, up and down, uh play, stop. They've got, I mean, they've got standard sort of intuitive um things that are always used. That's cool. I like it. Um. Uh speech recognition, I think, so we need a microphone presumably. Yeah. I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use? Glad, we're not doing this for real. Yeah. And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone I would put it sort of sub-centrally, so it's Yeah. So it can be sort of held and w We really need really gonna need to hold it, if it's gonna be voice recognition. Oops. Um. Upsidaisy. I s I still like it. Um but that's me. Yes, or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far. I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes. Um don't wanna sort of overkill. 'Cause I mean like uh if we I mean how good is the speech recognition thing? Do we want to go for buttons at all, do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit? Yeah, you know, and then you just tal I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly. Um. Yeah. Make them make them think of fruit, yeah. I mean uh some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh, I dunno, an apple. Then it's just apple so sort of Uh, yellow apples though Hmm. Yeah. Okay, yeah, that's good. Groovy. Yeah,. Yeah. So I mean like you could actually Yeah, gives you the options. So a selection of casings. It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um Like like mobiles, yeah. You can standardise those, I mean. I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons, 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it, 'cause they want to look at it, if they're using it, and what they want to look at is facing away from them. It doesn't really You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it, unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side, and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down. And you've got the facia, and you can just talk at the Maybe. So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so we stick with what we've got there. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Well, it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow. So again I mean like we could have, uh I mean, we could quite easily have the the main body be a different colour, but have kinda going round, yeah. Um I mean e even if I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour, so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together. So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing. W sort of Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it, it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it. Uh yeah. Yeah, I like that, yeah. Yeah. Okay. You shake it and scream at it. Yeah. It does leave them with an obligation to Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated. Then if it's just sitting on the Okay, okay. Right um what are the other options? Yeah. I'm I'm with uh Raj on that, I think, you know, I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house, there's not really ever sun coming in my window. Oh that's true. I mean I w I w uh that idea that I thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a, yeah, having a rechargeable stand, so that not only it doubles as a stand, but um for using it as uh recharging it, but also for using it as sound recognition. Yeah that kind of thing. Yeah. Rechargeable.. What's chip on print? What's Sorry, never mind. Yeah, and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping. That's good. Uh woah. Okay, we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing. Um we're kind of running out of time, so if you could Uh. Was that you? Um that was your bit's covered, I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next. Um, yeah. Oh, yeah. And I just touch the pad. It's actually shut down. Okay, um now what we have uh our next meeting's in half an hour and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay. Yeah. It's you guys. Yeah. So um, you know I mean, luckily we chose a nice simple shape. Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches. Uh yeah, I hope I can recover this, 'cause I've accidentally deleted it. Which doesn't really help me much. Yeah, can you save that uh send that last one again, please, Raj, as I still can't find it on the Okay. No. Okay, thank you. Um yeah, Project, Project Documents. Uh right, that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents. Project Documents is on the um desktop. Really? Oh right, I think um Hold on. Yeah, I don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my um on my agenda. S Um presumably there's clay somewhere. Um. Four. Whoops. Light, light, please. Light. Right, there you go. Yeah, quite. And we're using this our basic chip set, so it's all good. Um I think we're almost done, yeah. Oh oops. Sorry man. Uh okay, still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and Uh. Apples. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. 'Kay, so we came up with that, that's okay. What's supplements? Supplements. Uh uh. See. I shoulda something like that. If I kn see I I knew that. I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape. Just for cruelty. I wonder if they mean like literally make it, sort of buttons and everything. Um. Uh no, I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions, 'cause I'm confused. Huh? Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute, it's a There we go. Warning, finish meeting now. I rounded it up far too fast. Um. Where are we going? My Documents, that's not what I want. My Project Documents. There we go.","The Marketing Expert presented the results of a market survey that indicated users' most important preferences in remote control features. He discussed trends in fashion that should be incorporated into the prototype design. The User Interface Designer compared the designs of several competitors' remotes to decide which features should be used in their own design. She discussed using voice recognition, an LCD screen, and color to make the device easier to use and to improve its look. The Industrial Designer went over all of the internal components and materials that will be incorporated in the design. He gave a layout of the placement of the components in the device. The group decided to use a rubber or latex material to give the device a spongy feel. He discussed the color and shape of the remote with the group and the placement of the components on the device. The group discussed colors and shapes further, and decided that the remote will be yellow, and perhaps having a fruit-inspired shape. The group decided to use a rechargeable battery and recharging stand. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype."
130,"Speaker A: Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Yeah the universal ones. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm, it's about that. Mm. Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black. As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour? Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least. Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things? Because we always lose our remote control. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Then you lose it, yeah. Kind of um, maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah. No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ but Okay. So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said? Yep. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh no,. Sorry it's okay. Okay, cool.
Speaker B: Slim. Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market? What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices? What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market. So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player, M_P_ three player like any electronic devices. They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this. Yeah. Yep. Uh. Hmm.
Speaker C: Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros. So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah. So presumably that might be an idea to put into. Yeah, yeah. Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so? And that's quite a lot for a remote control. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. The the keyrings, yeah yeah. Okay, that's cool. Okay. Okay. 'Kay. So, we're looking for 'Kay. We're Sorry, carry on. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty. Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate. So you do the looking around at other remote controls. Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever. And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach. Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive. Uh. And you look at competition and design. Cool. So we have uh Um. Okay, groovy. And no doubt we'll get um Sorry. We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well. Okay. I shall I can't imagine these are worth much. Okay. Fashion into electronic. Okay.
Speaker D: Alright so twenty five. So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic. So uh Mm. But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features. For sure. Yeah, yeah. Right. Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this? 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily. Right. Okay. Wait for emails? Hmm.","The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device."
53,"Speaker A: 'Kay, hello everybody. Uh, I guess you all know what is it about, you all received the email, I guess. Uh, we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control. So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project. And uh so I'm present myself. I'm Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself. So I dunno, you can starts. Okay. And you are? In the project? So, uh, so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project, so um We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project. We are talking about the project plan, and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on, and, yeah. So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting. Um. So what is the goal of this project? Is to design a new remote control. So it should be, of course, new and original, and um it should be trendy, and user friendly. That mean it's a very challenging project, and uh uh. So w it's we will try to do our best, and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy. So, um So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project? So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way. Um. Yeah and everything is will be like this. Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project. So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here. So uh. For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it. Mm. Uh. So uh So I will ask you all to do the same. Just to get used to the whiteboard. Yeah, yeah, you can draw the picture, of course. Oh. Never mind. Yeah., no worry. You can draw it, if you want. Good. So good um So, let's talk about money. Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro. And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world. So n not only for Switzerland, but for the world. Uh. So, um. The We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro. Yeah, of course. Um, so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control, and any idea? So, if you have some experience, good or bad, with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea. Anything. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can Yeah, also if y when you take the the remote control, for example on the table, you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud, and you have a heart attack. Okay. Yeah so you can Do you have something? Yeah, that's true. Yeah without obstacles and. Okay. Let's continue. I have a meeting in five minutes, so maybe we should hurry. Um. So we will close uh this meeting. So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes. Um. Uh. The So I will ask you to do some work. Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control, start to to have new idea and read about Yeah. Oh. Industry and Oh. Yeah. So, um For the User Interface Designer, which is Hamed um, uh, you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control. And for the Marketing uh Manager, I dunno, okay, which is Bob, uh you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control. Um, you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach. Yep finished. So I see you in thirty minutes. Thank you.
Speaker B: Now what. Okay, so my name is Petre. You can call me Petre, or Peter if you like. I don't care. Uh, in the project I'm supposed to be the technic. Bob, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So probably I would try to try to draw the animal. Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal? I I th I think I should. Okay, so. Um. Okay, American, um. Um. I would use the bird. So I tried to sketch it out. I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it, but ah. Can you recognise it as a bird? Okay it's your turn to Oh it's okay. Yeah. I should get used to the tool, so. Oh just wait a little bit. C could we put it here, to make it as straight as possible? Ah probably not. Okay, it it works like this. Are you left-handed? Oh, pity. Ah, it's maybe better if you leave it. You won't draw them, or? Just try. I would like to see how it looks like. No, I think it's clear. It's okay. It's in it's indeed beautiful. Okay. Bob. Have to remember it. Bob. Per unit, I guess. Y oh okay. Okay. Oh. Okay, I have also some points uh. Maybe two points. Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light, so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light. And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room, so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery, so. So something like this. And the second thing, f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control. But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like. You know, some slider or Not just two discrete buttons for volume, but something which Yeah, but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down, or or make a high volume. Ah, n. If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream. Yeah, f It depends what what you feel about that. Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards, but if you have some more notes on that. Okay. Um. Okay, just a second. Which i which is Hamed,? Okay. Uh I am the Technical Designer, I dunno which one, uh v. User Interf Okay. Okay, so I'm the first one. I see. Sign. Okay. Uh.
Speaker C: Uh my name's Bob Mor. Oh, sorry. 'Kay. So my name's Bob Morris. I'm the Marketing Expert for this project. Bob yeah. Yeah go ahead. Okay, okay. So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat. That's its head. Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful. Okay. Thanks. Maybe put it up Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something. Uh, that's better. Your lapel microphone's fallen off. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we should just continue. Yeah, don't worry about it. No. Oh that's good, it's good. Yeah, and strong. Well, from experience, um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small, and it's been very hard to to to use, because there's so many buttons, and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what, and the buttons are very small and very hard to press. Um and and normally you only every use, you know, on a T_V_ remote you only ever use, mostly, you know, f four or f six buttons. Um. So it's frustrated me in the past, th that. Ah, okay. Okay. Okay, n Is that because the of the discrete volume levels, or is that Yeah. Yeah. Okay. He's the Industrial Designer? No, you're the Industrial Designer. Yeah, I think that's the first. I_D_. Industrial Designer. And the second one is the User Interface Designer. And then last one's marketing, which is me. Great, okay. Thanks guys. Bye.
Speaker D: My name is Hamed Getabdar, and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project. I dunno if I should go with this. If it is enough line. I'm sorry. Okay. They should be remote. Okay, thanks. No. Okay. Should I clean? Okay, I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful, so if I want to write it here, I think I can. Oh. Okay. I dunno if I can. Okay. It may be like a cow or I dunno, whatever. I'm not good very good in drawing. Okay, so this is very It's a bird, I think. I dunno what is it. Four. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I'm shameful Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh I Yeah, just a simple experience. I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves, because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune. Mm. Yeah. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, thanks. Bye.","The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves by name and their role in the project. The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then had the team members participate in a tool training exercise in which each member drew his favorite animal on the white board and discussed what he liked about the animal. The project manager also discussed selling prices and the project budget. The team then discussed their experiences with remotes, focusing on various features they would like to see in the remote they will produce, as well as features they find unappealing in current remotes."
90,"Speaker A: Okay okay Okay. Hello. Okay. My name's Poppy. I'm the Industrial Designer for this project. Um, I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase. Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product. Okay. Okay. So this is a television remote control? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Got those notes. Okay. Okay. Oh, to go first. Oh, are we all doing it individually? Okay, let's stand up and support you Okay. Do you have elk where you come from? You do. Okay. Sheep. Yeah, cows. That's a great elk. Yeah. Brilliant. Mm. Very nice. Okay. Okay, I'll go next. I am a big animal lover. I like all sorts of animals, but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat, in memory of my poor cat that died recently. It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing, but never mind. Not as artistic as Heather's drawing. Bit more cartoon style. But I like cats because they're so independent, and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing. Um, but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable, 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well, and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and, um, running around outside as well as being inside, and enjoying their food, and generally just, they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing. Uh I reckon they're sort of, they got it sorted. They know what they want. Basically, that's why I like cats. I'll rub that out. There you go. Ooh. Well there are loads of different types of dogs, so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog. We can pretend. Okay. Yeah, that's true. Very nice. Okay. Okay. I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing. It's always, where is the remote control? So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was. I dunno, some kind of alarm. You can press a button on your wall, signal, 'cause it always gets lost. Yeah. Yeah, that you don't use half of them. Yeah, that's, that's Yeah, it is. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. A novelty. Are we going into kind of novelty factors here. Like, I've seen phones like a Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I suppose, if we're he heading to have it, like make a huge profit out of this, it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing. Like, a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than, like, a general kind of more acceptable But we don't wanna go towards boring, 'cause that wouldn't sell either. So, hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Industrial Designer. That's me. Mm-hmm. Okay. Thank you.
Speaker B: Alright, that did nothing. Okay. Welcome to the meeting everyone. Just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show. Sorry guys. I did. Twice. This'll just take a moment. Or it won't. Okay we'll have to deal with it like this then. Alright. Um. This is the first meeting uh for developing our, our new product. I'm Heather, I'm your Project Manager. Okay. So um. So that was the opening. The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another. If everyone could go around and explain their role and um, and their name. Nice to meet you Poppy. Alright. Alright I'm Heather and I've I said I'm your Project Manager, um Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing. But um um Yeah. And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today, um um as well as planning the project, how we're going to, uh, create this product, and, um, discuss, um, our aims and objects of this, uh Which brings us to our next subject, is, um, um, as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control. Um, we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy, um, a completely new style, so that, um, can really appeal to a, to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of, uh, channel-changer. And, um, it needs to be user-friendly for, um, maybe, for an example, for people that, um, can't see the numbers as well, or, um, perhaps an ergonomic design. Yes, it's a television remote control. Right. I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now. So, alright. Um, yeah. Um, the way that we're going to go about this is, um, we'll have a time where we can, um come up with new ideas alone, and, and work on the project and then, um, after we've brainstormed and, and thought about, we can come together in a meeting and, and discuss what, what um, what kind of functional design we want to use. Same with conceptual design and detailed design. So, um, making sure that it, it's usable, that as a, um and that it's, it's feasible to create, and uh, to come up with a concept of it want, what we want it to look like. Um, tool training. Is, is everyone, um Okay. Great. Great. Um One thing that, uh, we're going to do is become more acquainted with the, the tools that we have access to for our project. Um, one of them is our whiteboard. And, um, as a sort of team-building moment, um, I, I'd like us to, um, try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal. Um, why that, why that should be your favourite animal. So, um, I, I'm assuming that we should do that now. 'Kay. With our microphones still attached to our bodies. Okay. 'Kay, what's my favourite animal? Do come up. This is a team-building time where, um,, okay cool, um My favourite animal, which changes all the time, okay, right now it is an elk. alright, so And it goes like Yeah it's got like big antlers, yeah. Looks kinda like, like it has holly growing out of its head. Yes. Yeah we have moose and we have deer. Do you have 'Kay, um. Thanks. This is my Okay. That's a sketching of my my elk, and it, it is my favourite animal right now, 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature, that um, that um In a way it looks kind of awkward, because it's on spindly legs and it uh But it can really overcome harsh terrain, and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous, because it has um strong antlers, and uh it can really combat its enemies, even like it it's a it's an herbivore but, uh, it can really defend itself. Yeah. Right. Right, I'm gonna take minutes while, um, you guys express your favourite animals. Oh. Great. I forget her name. It looks kinda like a person. It's kinda like a peacock. Great. Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that? Yea Right. So, now that we know how to use the whiteboard, um, the next, um, thing we need to address is our financial department, to meet our our budget, um or not meet our budget but more, um, like what kind of, uh, selling range we'll be looking at, um, wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros. And so we have to, um, come up with a way to, to create a, a uh remote control, where um we can like the price to create it will be significantly less. Um, we'd like to, um to, uh, make fifty million Euro. I'm assuming that's what the M_ means. Um, and make it for an international market. Um, one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of, um, like different kinds of, uh, V_C_R_s. Things like that, depending on which country you are. Another thing for the design team to think about. Um, we want it to cost, uh, absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents. I'm bad at math. 'Kay. Um, so now that, um, that is underway, um it is discussion time. So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas, any um suggestions that you may have so far, a um your personal experiences with remote controls, and um, um, areas you see that, uh, could be improved in your experience with them. Does anyone have any initial thoughts? Mm-hmm. So what's something we could, uh, do to remedy that? Yeah. It's a great idea. It's a great idea. Alright. Anything about, um, the look of the, uh, remote control that you might have ideas about. Maybe it could be, instead of like a standard rectangular shape, it could be, um, something more interesting like Any ideas will do that you have at this point. Can hold it. Yeah. Well if it's a trendy original, um, aspect we're going for. I mean, you're the designers, you c, you can um decide what kind of, um, direction you wanna go in, but at this point in the, in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And the key issue here is, is being trendy and original. Um, that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous. Right. Okay we have five minutes left. So, just to cover We have one more thing. Um, like you can go over your ideas, of course, in your own personal times. Um, our next meeting will be in half an hour. So you have half an hour to, uh, think about what you want to present. Or not present but bring to the meeting. Um, I_D_, whatever that stands for. Industrial Designer. I have to remember these things. Um. You'll be beginning your, your working design. Um, U_I_D_ the technical functions design will, will be worked on the next thirty minutes. Um, maybe how this can be achieved, and, um, we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert. Um, you will get specific instructions, um, of what to do in the next half an hour. And I'll see you in half an hour, okay? 'Kay.
Speaker C: My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer. I will also be responsible for the functional design phase, the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design. Gosh. Yeah. An elk? A vicious We have sheep. That is really good. I'm quite Very good. Okay. I think my favourite animal would be a dog, but I'm not really sure how to draw one. I, I've never drawn a dog, I don't think. I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw. Um, right it's gonna be a really funny dog, 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog. It's a cartoon dog I think. A s I don't ev Oh, oh well. It's a scary cartoon dog. That This, that does not look like a dog. I'm sorry. How do you draw a dog? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god. Right. Yous know what it's supposed to be. It's a dog.. Um, I like dogs because, um, they're so good to humans, like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs, and they're just such friendly animals. And, like they're more of a companion than cats. I've nothing against cats. Cats don't really like me, so I can't like them. But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals, that don't look like that. Yeah. Do yous not find that, um, like, there's a lot of, um, buttons on your remote control, and you don't know what half of them do. Yeah, I don't know what they do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker D: You may have to do the function F_ eight thing. Oh, okay. Hi, I'm Genevieve. I'm the Marketing Expert. I'm an expert at marketing. Um, I'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product. Um, I'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design, and product evaluation for the design phase. Yeah. Thank you. We have moose too. Uh-oh, we have a good artist. Oh, very shapely. Oh. Tara or Tara. That's Pinocchio. Alrighty. I feel like a robot. Okay. Um, well I guess I had the most time to think about it. I'm going to draw a butterfly, because I saw a butterfly yesterday, that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving. And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild, and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland. It was like, well it was a little pointier than that. At first I thought it was a dead leaf. And then it landed on the wall next to me. But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this. And then it kinda there was a green, I think it was a green ring, and there was like red going out like this. Yeah, it kinda was actually, 'cause it was This part of the body was really dull, and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever, and I'm like, wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March. So I thought that was pretty cool. And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes. I wish I'd had my camera. So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here. Yeah. There you go. Uh, what do we Oh. Yes I do. Okay, so we'll have a hundred percent profit then? Twelve fifty. Okay. I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing. Um Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel, so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something. That's useful. So you just have like the number buttons, power button, T_V_ video button. Could be shaped like a conch, you know. Be like a shell-shaped remote.. Interface? Oh, industrial. Marketing Expert.","The project manager opens the meeting by introducing herself and asking everyone to say their name and role in the group. She then states the agenda of the meeting and tells them that they will be designing and creating a new remote control that should be trendy and user-friendly. The meetings will focus on functional, conceptual, and detailed design. Next, each group member draws their favorite animal on the whiteboard and explains the characteristics of that animal. After that the project manager covers the project budget, and then they begin discussing their personal experiences with remote controls and how they want their remote to look. Then the project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what to do in preparation for the next meeting."
8,"Speaker A: You could change the vegetable, or fruit. Yeah. It's been a l It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable, and that the user can use it, you know, it's not too big. Uh but we think that this you know, this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow. And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually, would be the um thing the locator. How how so Okay so that's just So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed. Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset. You could have a broccoli, or you could have a mango. So. Tada. Mm. Yeah. Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own Is it meeting three minutes? No it's not minutes. Okay. Okay. Cool. True's one and false is seven. So it's actually a scale. Okay. Does it feel fancy? No. Yeah. Okay. One. Hmm. Um three. Yeah. So it's a one was true and seven was false? Okay, so you guys really didn't like it? I was like, why did you guys design it that way if you hated it? Yeah. One. Uh three. One. Uh two. Uh one. Yeah. Uh one. Uh. One. One. One. Two. One. Which one is that again sorry? Three point one? I think What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? And like then it you could hold it in your hand better. Yeah. The flat one. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't yeah. But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat But it's still too big I think, in your hand. Yeah. Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection, like you could probably do a strawberry still. I think the broccoli would be out. You could do, although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say, like sorta like a joystick. I don't know. So Uh. Rhubarb. These obscure fruits. I think we needn't Huh? Oh okay. Yeah. That could work. Yeah. Yeah. I dunno. Yeah. 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously. Or like I dunno, some of 'em you can kind of think see as like like you could if it was only this you know, if it was shaped like that, and it just had that. But you see the problem is you have to attach that, and this has to be detachable. So like maybe that's just too big because Yeah it's sorta like a joystick. I dunno. I guess Yeah. Dif Yeah. Yeah. Like uh we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. We could tr I don't know. Cool. Well Yeah the broccoli I guess wins. We were a bit off task. Um so uh I can't think of any So we'll have to like Mm. Yeah I dunno. You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes, but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like, but you could do like Yeah that's true. Yeah. Yeah that's true. Mm. Hmm. I did. The prototype making was very creatively stimulating and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria. I think you were fine. You did a good job leading. Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much, as we just would be like I don't know, all had ideas about it but yeah. No. Hmm. I felt like my I dunno if it was just my role, but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had. But there's kinda it was kinda like okay, I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here. So I didn't really think it was helpful. So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations, so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead. But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally, think it's kinda stupid. Yeah but uh Yeah. It didn't really yeah. So like a f Yeah I think so. Yeah I mean, it Yeah I kinda thought that um I felt like I would go and like try to use my information, or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time. But um Yeah. I wanna s I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the Yeah I think I'd like to um I dunno. Like it was the I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down, but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like. Yeah I dunno. But they're they're okay. Uh I think, and I think that uh all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes, or like I dunno. Hm. I guess it would be it's gotta be worth it to I 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful, 'cause can't really imagine, dunno. How about a p a? Um I dunno. Yeah. M meeting adjourned. I think it would be a good idea, I like it.
Speaker B: Okay well um. So our design looks something like this. This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever. This is a button, serves as the power button if you hold it down, and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu. And uh the base of the remote control, which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel, is interchangeable. So you can change the colour, according to your to suit your living room or whatever. And it comes yeah, I can change the vegetable. This one's broccoli. So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want. This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it. This is a mango. The it's trendy fruit, it's not just ordinary fruits. You don't have orange, you have mango. Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy, but So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control. And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them, because they'll need to switch 'em out. Mm-hmm. Well the locator is just chip that's inside there. And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere. Yeah we didn't design that. But it would be coordinating with that of course. Mm-hmm. My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes. But it's really not very clear, because you got single curve and double curve and d I dunno what that means. One side is curved and then the other side is curved. Mm-hmm. No I think that's alright. Mm-hmm. Hmm? Feels like play-dough. I'm gonna say yes. I imagine they're somewhere on the front. We have a little case that you slip 'em in. 'Kay Five. Five. It's four if you wanna do that. It adds to sixteen, so that's four. Oh I thought she said five. Six. Huh? Wait a minute. I thought it was the other way round too. Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points, you know, all the way up to the top. I'll just I'll just reverse them all. It's no problem. I thought you guys hated it. Okay. Say two. Two. One. Uh two. Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason. Mine has all kinds of problems. Uh three. Wait why did I put three? I meant one on mine too. Three point one. I have four. Three. One. Two. Three. Two. Mm-hmm. I think the wheel would probably be mm. I think the base would definitely be larger, 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. They're kinda smallish. Yeah. Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable. Mm. Not that I can think of. Rhubarb. So it's just colour, and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry. We could make it that shape but just have different colours, and call 'em the different fruits. We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough. Mm-hmm. That everyone gave that a one or a two. Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote. No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door, yeah um like on a normal remote. So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there, but it'd be on one of the sides probably. Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape. Um, I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff. It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape. I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too. Sure. Sponginess. I think it was good. We knew what we were doing. It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute. Well you told us when to start and when to end, and that's all that matters. Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft, PowerPoint or any of this stuff. No no I never touch Macs either. I just use the Unix or the off market, sort of WordPerfect and all these other things. Yeah. Well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it. So I have all these documents I can't use now. But yeah I mean I guess it's okay. Yeah. I never use it. Yeah. My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works. Yeah it probably does. Yeah. Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control. As if you'd wanted to. Well I think it's interesting how it all went together, like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap, and you have how people want it to be spongy, and It seems planned you know. Yeah. If I hadn't been told that fruit was They're pretty cool. They're kinda hard to write with though. They're nicer than the pen that I'm using, because like your stuff actually shows up here, rather than having to look at the screen and write. But even so, I dunno. Oh yeah. Well they drop off if you like move too much. But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones. Maybe we are. I don't know. Well the thing is, like I actually worked in a company, and I had a role and I had to go to meetings. And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting. Like usually I missed meetings deliberately. There's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting, like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company. It's mostly like rehashing old stuff. And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know. It's like the there's just really not a lot of information that goes through. It seems like way overkill. Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence. I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings. It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention. Especially if you have food. All of us?
Speaker C: 'Kay. Hmm. Okay everybody. Welcome to the detailed design meeting. Um Let's see. Our agenda. Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that. Um and I think looks like we've come up with some ideas. Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary. Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that. Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it. Um so actually I think Yeah um f you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of Oh is that broccoli? 'S a very bright strawberry. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh. Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder, there's an Excel spreadsheet. Um the only one that's in there, production costs. And if you open it up. Um I've just stuck the numbers in, it was a real challenge there. But if I missed anything that we've gone over, or if you see something that has changed I mean, we decided on batteries, and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button. Um I said uncurved or flat. I think that's what you have there, is that right? For the for the plastic part would be Oh. Okay. Right. Well yeah. If we're talking about the area just oh I d I dunno. I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see. Um so what else? There's plastic for that area around the button. Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right? Um and lots of special colours actually. Uh scroll wheel. Do you see anything that I've missed? Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine, which is even less than twelve point five, which means we'd be making even more of a profit. And if we sold a lot of squishy things. Boo yeah. Okay. S So Mm. Did y what did you work on? The Okay. Do you wanna Okay. I think that's Huh, the PowerPoint one? Yeah. Um we can do it separately and then discuss it if if that's what people wanna do. Wait, one is true and so these are the questions we're answering. And one is One, right okay. If it's somewhere in between you put four. Okay. Are we just about ready? I don't think so. It's yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we Our animals will forever be there. Un unless you feel you need it t to okay okay. We'll Five. I I think we should Yeah. Yeah. Six. I wasn't cheating I swear. Uh. Oh I thought it was the other way round. So we do have about the same thing, we just have it the other way Oh gosh. Okay. Well Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Three. Two. One. Two. Two point I think I missed two. Wait, is that two point one? One point four, one point five. Okay right that's I have two of them. One. Yeah. Yeah. Three. Three. Two. Five. Four. Two. Okay. Um No no that's um I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four, where um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote. The that was material. Mm. Um Mm-hmm. Does the shape See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the is it uh gonna be the size, like the the controller? It or bigger? Because Yeah. No but I imagine even if it was bigger, like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers. Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. Yeah. And would it even resemble fruit that way? I mean Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that I I when you were holding that before, it actually looked yeah. Yeah. What if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber. You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah. Or I mean we could even have fruit like around I mean But if we if we need yeah. And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow, there might be I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that, which is a nice kind of yeah. But I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape? 'Cause like kind of Yeah, yeah. Or like even Or even like Yeah like you said, like a joystick like that. You know? 'Cause that, I think I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea. And you still have the comfort of holding it like that. And you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part. But I mean it do we have any other ideas about that? The batteries are going in the back? The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip no you could Just like any other one. Okay. Yeah. Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. Yeah. And it would probably cost more to produce, 'cause they're irregular. Yeah. Which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit. Mm. Not really Well we've done finance evaluation criteria, production evaluation. Um so project evaluation. I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied oh, oh it's alright. Uh. Yeah. Um Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of Yeah. I mean fruit and squishiness. How c more creative can you get? And how was our leadership and teamwork? Well I thought my leadership was crap personally. Excuse me, am I allowed to say that? Yeah. Um. Yeah, well I'm never gonna do a management position, I know that now. Um yeah, I thought we all worked very well together. Yeah. Yeah. Very democratic. No spats, that was good. Um and the means for like the materials we used, how convenient were they? Like the the pens, the whiteboard, I mean we used Are you a Mac person? Huh. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I can't say I found everything particularly helpful. Like I It Really? I mean m my problem yeah, yeah. 'Cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff right? See I couldn't do that, so I didn't really know what you guys were doing. And when you were talking about it I was just like you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things, 'cause I Yeah. Yeah. System. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, huh. Yeah. Yeah. Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know? So it's Oh right. given certain information or Just yeah. Mm, mm. What do you guys think of the pens? It asks about that. Mm. Yeah and I I've f forgotten once or twice to check the box. Mm. And new ideas found? Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time? Any other ideas for Um we still have time if there's any other input. I mean the I think we did really well personally, which is why we've you know, gone through this so quickly. 'Cause I mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory, it fits the budget, and it's trendy. So. Um. So I think that's all for today. Meeting adjourned. Yeah. So I guess we're supposed to write final reports. 'Cause I don't know. Hmm. Hmm. Or is that just me?
Speaker D: Um evaluation criteria. I've got a presentation. So I need where's the cable? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start. Um. Right. This doesn't okay. Um the method is we well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing. And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way, feel in a certain way, and this is everything's listed down. Um, look in a certain way, feel in a certain way, it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use. These are all things we looked at at the start, um and criteria that have to be met. We have to use a table, I'll show you that later, together to decide whether it meets the standards. And we we have therefore in total um We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated. And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria. I would like to show you the table we have to use. Um. No. This is the table. Can you see this here? Um so the que the questions I've given you c could you write that down? True is one and and false is seven. And we'll just go through each point together, hopefully. Um. I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow. I dunno how it works exactly, I haven't been told. Yeah it's in the um it's in the project documents. It's called evaluation criteria. And it's under evaluation. Yeah. You've found it all? So it was um Yeah true's one. Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly? Yeah okay. Um, yes it's if it's fancy you put one, if it's really unfancy it's seven. Yeah, something. They shouldn't really be questions. Should be more like Are the batteries easy to insert? Yes? Very very true. Okay. Okay. Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard. Do we um is it necessary? We'll just do um Yeah. Okay. I don't feel any right um Right so one point one? We'll just go in a circle. Right. Ooh I don't know. Right. One? Five. Two. Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? Is that what the company does? Yeah? Oh no. It adds to thirteen. One five five two. One five five two is thirteen, over four for now. I think that's um next? Really? Two. Uh-oh. Right. One point three is Yeah. I really Well uh Yeah yeah. It was one is true and false is seven. I should've kept the table up. Right, well I'm glad this came out. Yeah. No. Oh that's quite funny. Okay. Okay. So, starting again, one point one? Two. Okay, one point two? Two. Okay. Um, one point three? Ha. Two point one? Yeah. Oh dear, okay. Sorry. Two and one. Sorry about that. T two point two, which is one point five. Okay. Three point one. Is that correct on my slide? Yeah? One, four, three, three, three point two? Three point three. Four point one? Two. Four point two. Two and four point three. One, two. Right so I put one on that. Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue. Or is it tedious? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone. I didn't know how else to do it. Okay. Well the worst ones were three point one. Do does every ones have the slide? Three point one. Slide show. Material technologically innovative, okay. Um, do you want to change it? What are the suggestions? I don't know, anyone? Yeah that it's three point one was not that good. Four point one. The shape. Four point two? Yeah. That looked really good. Are there any fruits that look like broccoli, no? I think that broccoli is my favourite actually. Uh despite the Yeah. Yeah and just have the colour match or something. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one.. Batteries easy to insert for some reason, which can be easily I think that's not a problem any more. No. I think everyone's under three anyway. So I think it's yeah those are the only two points. Yeah. Do you want this and we can all No. It's alright yeah? Yeah. Yeah we didn't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well. Which isn't very user-friendly though. I though it was brilliant no? No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think. I think it depends on the role no? Yeah. But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um a whole system, 'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the Yeah, yeah. No. But I think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing. Yeah, like if everyone's given the same input I don't have a clue, anyway. Um what's next? Looks like oh no that's not um It's quite Yeah. Yeah it's all very new, no? It's all very new. Sorry. What what's the end? Are we are we supposed to um you supposed to write a report? Or we ending? Is that the end? End of meeting. You have to tell her, she Okay we have to fill in all this stuff. Stuff stuff stuff. Yeah. Well there's al eight, nine. Ooh. Oh ooh.","The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed the changeable fruit- and vegetable-shaped covers. They discussed the locator function that will be designed at a later time. The Project Manager discussed the final production cost for the device, which totaled 11.9 Euros. The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype. Each participant rated the prototype according to the original criteria for the project. The group discussed the areas in which the prototype did not meet these goals. The group felt that the changeable fruit and vegetable shapes were uncomfortable to hold. The group decided to make changeable covers in fruit colors and designs and to use one uniform shape. The group discussed their experience on the project. They felt they worked well together and were creative. They complained that the meeting-room materials were difficult to use, and some complained that there was not enough information provided to them. The Project Manager instructed all participants to write a final report at the end of the meeting."
13,"Speaker A: Mm-hmm. Marketing Expert. Mm. Okay. Yeah. No sure. Uh it's David Jordan. Course. Mm-hmm. No, no. Uh this one doesn't want to be moved, I think. So, I dunno, it's maybe difficult to have both, I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and then Yeah. Oh it should okay, yeah. The user should know. Yeah, that's gonna be the trick. Okay. So that's the point. Mm. True. Okay. What the cost is? Twelve, twelve a half. That might just So. Okay. What's the average price of this technology then? But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a I don't think well, yeah, I don't think he would, but in a sense The wire? Yeah. True. Uh that's my job. That's the Now the Yeah. Well that's actually one of the point, yeah? True. This you will see in my presentation then. Yeah. Which is participant four. So just trying to answer all the questions, if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh. We've made a study, so could you go to next slide. Sorry for the functional recurrence. So that's the standard method for marketing, okay. We had one hundred subjects, um, we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire, um, and see what was okay or not for them. Okay. So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered. Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly, okay, so that's Yeah, the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job, David, maybe. Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly. So this is where we could have uh yeah, good market, I guess, if people are ready to pay more. So it's it's interesting information, I think. And then um yeah, the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime, because it's too many buttons and so on. So we should change this as well. And uh users are actually zapping a lot, so they're using the device intensively, that's something to take into account as well. And um, you know, ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control. And uh this is one of the main point for me. But I'll come back to it later. 'Kay. Could you go next slide? Uh, so as you said uh, remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. So this is from the experiments we've done, so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user, I think. Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people. And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users. R_S_I_ is like, when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times, then you get injured. Okay? So, those numbers are less important then the previous one, but still it has to be taken to count. So last slide. Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs. If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent, okay. And definitely if it could have less buttons, still maybe the same number of um functions, but less buttons, this would definitely be a good way of selling more. Okay. So Yeah, remember the user is not happy to read the manual. It's Yeah. Yeah, this is something we sh But this was first step and This was the first step, yeah. Specially distribution, yeah. Uh Yeah, but this is what we would ask to the users, so. Yeah. Yeah, remember it's twelve Euros. Hmm. Yeah, it's done, just yeah. If we would if we could remember like, not too many buttons and make it look fancy, I think it would make it. So. Lame, or Mm-hmm Yeah. Mm-hmm. So has to be yellow. I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway. It's maybe more in browsing. Yeah. Hm-mm. Mm-hmm. Min Yeah. Regarding the first line, what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext. And that's it. It's already changed for Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer. Yep. Okay. Yeah.
Speaker B: Industrial Design. One one. Three three, it's three sorry. In one, sorry. So you didn't save it maybe. Alright, so David Jordan? Mm-hmm. Too great for email then. Yeah. To merge the two system huh. Mm yep. But But this is Yeah. Yeah you maybe you have some international standards, where you know, if you can use one is the other are or almost the same, so the sign. Yeah, yeah. For example, I dunno here, escape, you know, you have escape in computers you have, so if you see escape, you know that it should be the same. So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international, you know that So. Yeah. So. Yeah, but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system, alright. That's your job It you Okay, okay. Participant two. Yeah. The rationale must be design, or So we can move to the next slide. As you all know, you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control. So the re basically the remote control will be, you know, infrared control, so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device, like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_. So, this one is leather bu based but I propose a nifra infrared base you know, so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ so you know, so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than, you know For the cheap price we have, for the cheap price we want to I think it's cheaper than laser, so. Yeah, I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh Let's see. Yeah. You can move to the next slide, so. So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just, you know a bulb and an infrared bulb, so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside. You can go to the next slide. I have some kind of pictures you know, here. You have the b the bulb, it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important, so. This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device. Look. But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and. So and the next slide, it is the last one it's So it's I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know, it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you. Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both, but you know, I at my side prefer a wireless. Okay, so if you have some question I didn't answer? Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost, I dunno, around eight Euros, so. Or at least you know, the You'd yes, you can. It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know, put some energy inside, so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise, so. We can think that you know, with the wire, you know, without a wire. We can have both also. Yeah, but some pa I always want to have you know, sometime I want to have wire because you know. Uh, I don't think it will be too much. Have to think about the question, you know, 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical, so. Okay, yeah. Yeah but, it should be an agreement, you know, because even if you can think of the wireless, it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer, but you know. If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have, if you want to use, so it can be good to have a wireless, it it is a question. Right, so. Okay. Mm-hmm. The look, how it look like. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. The manuals. With a Look fancy. This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people, maybe the the marketing people. I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard Yeah, yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, hmm. Yep. So. Yellow. For cheap remote control, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet, so. This is Yeah, but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to, you know, connect to internet, you know, surf the web. Okay. It's pop I don't think it's popular, so that's the problem so. You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know the global usage, so if people don't have the technology. Yellow? Do you think that people like the colour yellow? I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_. Or should be. Yeah, so. Doesn't need to be completely yellow, but just mm. But I dunno, but why, nobody's a threat to me. Industrial Designer, yeah. Component component, yeah. Good. Okay Okay, that's clear.
Speaker C: Okay. Okay. No no no. One. I I think I'm a. In one. It's mine. Mm yeah. Okay. Okay, so. The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control. Uh I I will focus on user interface design. Um so move to the next slide. As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions, as we show from this picture. There's a lot of functions. Over, I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control. So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions? Um, let's move to next slide. Um. Yeah. So I so we want to design uh elegant, easy to use inter interface. A very good example is Google. As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function, but with very easy to use user interface. Um so move to next s slide. So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface. So That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation. Uh With sophisticated functions, but with very yeah powerful. Yes. Yep. Yeah. But if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it. Yeah, that's my job. That's my job. It's not the easiest I've got to. Yep. Powerful and easy to use. Yeah, that's the point. So what, the wireless remote control? There's a wire with remote control? Okay. Okay. Okay. Wireless remote control. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Design a wireless remote control. Yeah. Functions. Yeah. Yeah, I think possible. Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button. So lets you then you have less buttons. But I'm not sure No you you can have a switch menu, so you can well for example Yeah, I think so. Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes. Then for um you can have a switch menu, so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions. Then you you put the switch button, then it switch to another category of functions. Yeah. For example, if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder. So there's a different functions, but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder. So we can has less buttons. But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy, not funny. Because different people have a different opinion about fancy. You know. Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people, but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples, so. Yeah, personalised colour. Because you know Yeah, because maybe some people prefer a red remote control, some people prefer black remote control. Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options, so user can select which colour they prefer, so. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Control. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. But there's balance between function and the cost. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And cheap. A low cost. Yeah, there's that box in uh o of it. A pi There's that box in the T_V_, so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_. Ok It's It's not so uh popular now. Mm. Global, okay. So I I so As as for the colour, what what do you think? Yellow? T_V_ remote control? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Speaker D: So, I will open our functional design meeting. So, I will play role of the secretary. As also Program Ma Manager. So, we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer, User Interface Designer and um What's your talk? Marketing Experts. And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements, the decision on the remote control functions, and we will close the meetings after. Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer. Um, so you're participant two? No you're No, I'm participant one. Okay, never mind. 'Kay, did you save your presentation? Isn't that technical functions? Name's Jordan. So so I'll I let David Jordan do his presentation. Uh. Mm. So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful. So powerful, many functions and very easy to use. You mean this one? Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control, I suppose. Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that? Yeah um such as maybe the Go on, go back and So, you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use. Okay. So, next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things. So you you're Um. Okay. So, Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer. Okay. Mm-hmm. So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology? Yeah. Do y you know the requirements for the remote control? Twelve, nearly thirteen, yeah. The cost Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. What is this? Okay. Okay. Okay. So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea. No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno, I just may maybe you making a solu Yeah, but Yeah but as Industrial Designer, do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television? I'm just asking you. Do you think it will be cheaper? Could you answer please? Okay. Yeah, but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem. As it's yeah. I think it's more your problem. Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not. Okay, I'm sorry. So So just think of um the usability. Yeah. Just think of the problem. If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it? I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television, yeah. So I will let you to do your presentation, so. You mean the loo the look, the outside? Okay. Mm-hmm. What is R_S_I_? Ah um okay. Mm-hmm. Mm okay. And just to have uh an idea, do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control, you think it's possible? Sure? Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, but do you think it will be easy to use? Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know. Yeah, I think the Yeah, but it has to be intuitive. Yeah, okay. Okay, but Yeah, but Mm-hmm. Yeah, but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control. If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more. Yeah, it will cost little bit more. And also f Yeah, but as soon as you speak about options, it means that the price increases, and we don't really want the price to be too too high, because we wanna be able to produce it. So, we want something fancy, as uh previously said, Florent, something very easy to use, powerful and also as uh it's written here, seventy five percent of users, they zap lot, so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot. And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control, they want to zap between channels on T_V_. So I think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with uh the other members. So, is it okay for your presentation? Nothing else to to add? Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm so So, I had some new information about the product requirements, so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking, in your designing of the remote control. So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore, as it's something that's It's is uh No yeah, because now everybody has internet at home, so it's better to use internet then teletext. So, you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control, and also the remote control will only be used for television, so for y for you your designing, you're not you won't be uh you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that. It's because if we want to to do remote control which will be used for for the television, for the recorder, for the camcorder and all the others, it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that. We really want to focus on the remote control for the television. Is it okay? So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it, to have very powerful and easy. And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product, such as the colour and s the slogan. I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product. So you will have to use the colour of the product, of the um um of the uh of real reaction and uh also Yeah. As we say, we put the fashion in electronics, so it has to be a fashion remote control. Fancy, fashion, powerful, easy to use. Require lot of requirements, but Yeah. Yeah. But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches. Maybe not, but mayb So. So everybody is okay with the new requirements? I think it has to be yellow. Yeah. Maybe you can change the colour, but the image of the society has to be recognised. Why you go It has to be fashion. So you have to Yeah. It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society. Just when you enter you say oh, oh, it's real reaction. Think it's a re reaction remote control, so. And also it has to be attractive, of course, because if you want to sale to sell the remote control. It's okay? Yeah. Yeah. I think it would be simpler. Okay. So I will close the meeting, um just after that we'll have lunch break. And you will have in thirty minutes individual work. Uh Y you You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon yeah, and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept. And Florent to work my subject. And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. It's okay? I think the um session is closed. And by the way, Mister David Jordan, please record your presentations in your own folder. Not in mine. Should be better.",The User Interface Designer discussed  some characteristics and functions to consider in designing the remote and introduced an idea for giving the remote international appeal by merging it with a system such as Google. The Industrial Designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and presented options for components and materials which would keep costs low. The Marketing Expert presented consumer preferences and requirements. The project manager introduced the new requirements for the project. The team then discussed different features they could include in the design of the remote.
60,"Speaker A: How're we placed in terms of the alright. It fell That's why. Ah. Sure. Mm. I'm Ron. I uh once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the User Interface Designer. Go for it. Alright. Think I'm just gonna put down one uh one C_D_. Anybody? No? no? Afro beat orchestra, very cool. Yeah. Fift S they like fifteen members from Brooklyn. Um and I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium, in Brussels in April first. Yeah. It's supposed to be in Brussels anyways. Um thing I love about Edinburgh Love um I just came from Glasgow and I'm um happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately. Um. I w Does uh yeah. Ready? Minging? Nice. Uh-huh. Nice. Nice. I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control, we can't kind of build it into other uh products. For instance like a mobile phone or something like that. Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less? Yep. Okay. Mm-hmm. Nice. Hot. Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here? S does anybody have any initial ideas? But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things. Too confusing. Mm-hmm. Possibly. I'm pretty sure there is. I mean I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it'll figure out the the specifications of it and will control it um so I th I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world. Oh. I like the idea of the uh multi plate. In in I like. We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well. For those cold winter days. Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it. If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying. Th Yeah. That's cool. I think we could design into that. Curves. We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros? Slight difference I guess. No. Thank you.
Speaker B: Are you sure I got it all head's kinda small. Okay. We're okay? We're good? I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee. Mm. Uh okay. Very official. You're just gonna believe me, we'll go from there. Fair enough. Prove it yeah, okay. Works for me. There you go. I'm Sarah, I went to Michigan, and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something. Marketing, yeah Expert. Expert. Fine. That's me. So. So do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us? I'm waiting to know. Uh Fair enough. Oh, Smallville. I went to high school with Tom Willing actually. The guy. Yeah. Yeah. Very much so. Hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless. Yeah. He is a big guy. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Good call. Interesting. I guess I'll go next then. Okay. Don't wanna lose all my mikes, plugged in here. Okay. This is basically just pen practice huh? Okay. Oh you're much taller than me so I'm gonna write down here. Um. Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of, Chris Bathgate, local Michigan folk singer, really lame and uh uh what else did I bring with me? Probably classical, to totally geek it out, yeah I think. And my family guy D_V_D_s but we don't need to write that one down. So yeah. No. Are you getting it online, or is it on sky? Yeah, that'd be nice. 'Fraid not. Mm. Exciting. That'd be. Oh. I didn't even read those. Oops. I shouldn't admit that. Yeah. It's the five by five, I can't read that much. Yeah oh it's so horrible. Oh my God. Seriously? It really is Yeah. Slide it in there. Yeah. Yeah fair enough. I've already got more than I can keep track of. And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people, no. I know. I know. Oh it should be interesting. Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back. They're gonna love that one. Probably. Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide. 'Cause nice. Of course. Oh, now I can think of so many other ones. That's how it works. Mm. Oh Any thing that are like free. Nice. It must make all the difference. Ah. Right. Mm. There you go. Mm. Makes sense. Uh. What they're looking for. And negotiate that. Uh. I don't think there's any rules about it yet. So Yeah. Mm. W yeah. I like the little cover thingies. Hmm. Good idea. Start your minutes. Um Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal right, we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things, as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do, like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing, but then, I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons, you can't tell what they do. Yeah. Specific. Okay. Interesting. True. Mm. Mm. Right. We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart, that whole yeah. Hmm. Mm. An interesting option. Yeah. Definitely. Right. That Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Keeping it nice and slick, would be important. And I don't know, like, there's such a problem with losing them, that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose, so we're gonna have to be careful with what like Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool. Yeah. Fi b like what are they called, those face plate things? Isn't there a name for them? Are they? I dunno. Yeah. Something really cool. Leopard print or something. Hmm. True. Right. True. Right. Right. Right. Probably. Good. Mm. Yeah. And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years, very much so. Mm. Right. Right. Mm. Definitely. Yeah. Or if you our users in mind, like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design, no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to, and who we're gonna be able to get it out of. But Euros. Mm. Mm-mm. Mm. Okay. With half an hour? 'Kay. Perfect. Cool.
Speaker C: Like that? Okay, cool. Okay? Right, so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick. Yeah, PowerPoint. Yeah, well, you know,. Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it. Right. Um. So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction, this is uh so it right. Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting. Um We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training. Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet, the whiteboard. Um we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up. Um I guess you know game or something um in real life um so yeah basically I want to I'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that, I'm thinking about um uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask, don't tell. Um so um if you say something about marketing, right, sorted, um y is Exactly. Um I mean obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it. I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like yeah yeah exactly so, 'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um. And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun, you know maybe you went to um uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that, why not, you know you can this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it. So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical? Sweet. Cool. So I guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life I dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website. Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible, that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something. So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way. Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics. And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um um the other designer that I can't remember, the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um the Industrial Designer hey right on alright, getting into it um to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time. And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good, you know like um I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um, yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand, or something like that. Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up. So that's the detailed design. So it's a three stage kind of thing. Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it, I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could, not all five, if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um. Oh, we skipped introductions. Nice. I'm a excellent Project Manager. Um. I'm Marty, um I went to uni at uh U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology. Um yeah. So Expert Don't play yourself down. Expert Where did you go to uni Nathan? Oh brilliant. Cool. My little brother goes there. Right so desert island discs. Yeah. Well I'll t i no no yeah I'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down. See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are, I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but there's some other options, if you're a T_V_ slut like I am like Smallville terrible television show but I happen to love it, it's rubbish but I love it. T the the main c the main character? Wow. Is he a wanker? He looks really tall, like he's gotta be like six six. Yeah. Um okay so I really like Jeff Buckley. You guys heard of Jeff Buckley? Um that's cool 'cause like not very many people have. Um and um oh well I might as well throw a British person in there um you can't go wrong with Radiohead. It's a r Okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises I think. It's kinda weird. Anyway yeah. Yeah, you're like press and it's. Kinda cool. You'll see. Alright so um whoever wants to get up next, you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want. Right on. W Mm. Nice. Okay yeah yeah. Well yeah. Oh, family guy. Isn't h has h do you watch the new season? I think I'm gonna start downloading it yeah. Mm-mm. Afro beat orchestra? Very cool. Mm. Wow. That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for. It's they're designed specifically to ignore. I it's th brilliant. Ah yes yes yes okay I see that. Vomit. Yes. Street pizza. It's so brilliant. I've seen more urine in this city than ever before, I mean It's so minging. Uh. I'm going local. Going local. I have to be here for three years so I might as well get the terminology right. Oh, have you been home yet? They'll be like, say something British, and you're like oh shut up family. Right you s you're gonna stay here? Wow. Bad religion? Yeah yeah, yeah. Well yeah that's why yeah. I miss coffee. Burritos. Oh yeah two two bucks. Where are you from in California by the way? Did you really? What part? Yeah I'm from San Diego as well. Yeah oh man. Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego. Well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it like I when I went to school in the U_ in Santa Barbara which is central California the Mexican food is okay, it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks, like literally two bucks for this massive I miss yeah good call on that. Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego, I live like five minutes from the zoo. So North Park actually if you want to get real specific. Yep. Yes. On university, yeah. Yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house. Yeah, pretty cool. Small world as we were discussing before. Especially when we're all from the same general region. Right so okay, success on the whiteboard. You can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s and things we like about the city you know, I think we'll Um right so moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance. Um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros. Um. This is what the finance department has told me, the C_F_O_ but I don't know, I'm not sold on this, it's pretty dear, I mean twenty f that's like you know forty bucks for a remote. It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me. Um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it, the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it. Eur internationally. So um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably. Um so something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s but um you know I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing. Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty. So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can. Um s right so um just to close up, I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager, sorted. Um. Is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done, like what the basic function of it. Um U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do. Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want. So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have, you know like uh so yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email. But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth. Um any questions, before we get started? You mean to like Hmm. Yeah. Well, have a think about it. I mean I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able isn't it. I mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function. The clapper. No I mean no, good idea, good idea. We'll see what see what Uh-huh y I like that Yeah. That's true, I guess we we probably have some time, maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do, go back to um I don't really have any. Let me bring up something about our basic goals here, what we want to accomplish. Uh project announcement. Ts ts ts Yeah. Not so much. All right we'll find them, we're on our own. Yeah yeah let's do it, let's do. I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause Yeah I mean oh yeah right. So initial ideas. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah that's slick isn't it. I mean like stylist yeah like a just a yeah. Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this, perfect. Um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um uh size and functionality. Um and we also I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea of um so you like maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote? I don't think one exists. Be a good idea. Yeah all the other universal remotes. Um I don't know if there's such a thing out there, I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL, N_T_S_C_, region one Okay. Okay. Interesting. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um all right. So. I li I'm liking that idea, this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features. Um. Um. Let's see. Mm. Uh let's see. Um. Yeah yeah okay. Think they're just called face plates? I don't know. Um. Mm. But if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote. Um Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page. Kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones, you have a page button and it goes, could we do something like that? Um yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know Yeah. Yeah. We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno, selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote, twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price. Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know m massive, some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere. But um have a think about what we can do, have a think about what we want to do, how we're gonna sell it and um Mm. Twenty five Euros. Yeah. They're all weaker than they're all stronger than the Dollar. Although, computer parts, all if you're gonna upgrade your computer, buy it in the States. Like um do you guys know Fry's? Huge computer uh electronics store? They serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about. Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now, I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents, so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas, you can consult them at your leisure. And uh right so thanks for that. Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into. Um. Yes. Thanks guys.
Speaker D: Guess I should probably try to sit up straight. Oh, I think mine's fallen off. Wow. Oh yeah, that's fine. Right. I'm Nathan, I'm from California, and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology. U_C_L_A_. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Wow. No. Sounds nice. Oh, wow. There's more vomit there. Alright. Yep. Um Let's see. Yeah, that's the music I grew up listening to. And so there Something I miss about my hometown. Burritos that cost less than eight Pounds. I grew up in San Diego, but yeah um La Jolla, P_B_. But really uh I last lived in San Francisco, I haven't lived in Cali well I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen. It's different. 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them. Yeah, it really does. Mm. Yeah. Where you from in San Diego? Okay. Yeah, my grandparents lived on um thirty second. Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is, and Cafe Forte Cool. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Mm. Sounds interesting. Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that. Yeah. Maybe a remote with changeable faces, like the faces that you can buy for phones. Yeah. Yeah. S smaller's better. Simple. Oh right. That'd be different. Yeah. It's gonna be too complicated, too crowded with buttons and things. Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes. Right. I think, making it out of a nice material would be very important, because so many of those remotes that you see, these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality. Mm. something, uh we'll have to come up with a name, patent it. Leopard print. I think, it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device, maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote. Mm. True. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. 'S true. Okay. Alright.","The Project Manager presented the project to the other participants by discussing the aim of creating a new, fashionable remote control device and defined the roles and tasks of each participant. The group introduced themselves to each other and trained themselves how to use the whiteboard tools. The Project Manager discussed the financial goals of the project, including the projected profit aim and price point for the device. The Project Manager gave each participant their assignments. The group then began a discussion of their initial ideas about the remote control and possible features. The Project Manager announced that he would make a report containing the discussion of the group's initial ideas about the device."
89,"Speaker A: Oh. Oh, I got a nice little screen here over here. I got like this big black border uh on every side. I'll I'll fix it. Yeah, whatever. Yes. I don't know what the right order is. So Mm-hmm. Yes, I agree. Yeah. Yes. Yes. I haven't really found a conclusion like that. Yeah. Design. Sounds interesting. Alright. Yes. Yeah. It's alright. Um Alright, I've done some research for functional requirements. Um yes. The working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people, uh how do you say uh, f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions. Uh, I've lined them up here. Uh, ask whether um common remote control looks good or not, about willingness to spend money on remote control, about zapping behaviour, and uh and stuff like that. I uh have found some interesting things. We do we do got a market. Um, three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly. So if we make a trendy design, we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market, which you can reach. Um, three out of four users uh zaps a lot, as I uh quoted here from the uh results. Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour. That's quite a lot. Um, relevant options are, of course, power buttons. Although, only used once per hour. Uh, channel selection, volume and buttons for text, and the more um, yeah, other functions, like audio settings, video settings, sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used. Furthermore, fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control. That doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off. But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated. Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room. And um an important thing here, the most important customers uh, which is over seventy percent of our market, is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old. And uh elderly people, our market, are less interested in uh nice features, but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls. So, what I was thinking oh, wrong side. We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control, because elderly people will get th lost. Group features for a higher usability, uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting. Um, all the settings, about audio settings, video settings and channel settings, which are not very often used, we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever, because they are used very rarely and well, it uh there are a lot of options there, so we can really make uh yeah, how do you say, we can spare at buttons over there. And um, if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options, group them in the button, not too uh Yeah. Small buttons, so they won't be very um, how do you say Yes, won't be very present, thank you. And a trendy look, well uh, although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever, I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent. That was kind of what I found. Okay. Yes. Two? No uh, I agree, I agree. Not too much, no. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. I don't really agree actually, to be honest. It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty. It's only like thirty percent of the total market. Mayb yeah? Okay. Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit. Not too much then, bu alright. Yes. Yeah, I'll have a look. We put the fashion in electronics. Sense and simplicity. Well, to be honest, if um our uh aim group is uh till forty, not older than forty, maybe that's not very uh yeah, we don't really need to have a simple remote control. I think we can implement more functions then, because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more Yes. Yeah. Well, I think Yes. Yeah, control. Not much more than that. Yep. Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever. So t Yeah. Y yes. But but for for example, V_C_R_, that's better example in this case. I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever, just play, stop, rewind and uh fast forward. Yeah, I know, but uh Yes. Yeah. Alright. Yes, definitely, yeah. Yeah, and maybe two or three other options, but not nothing more than that. I think stop function is very useful. If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages, and you are not a very quick reader, then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up, but Well, I use it very regularly, the action. I re I use it quite often. Might be. Might be. I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present, yep. Yep. If you grab the remote, your hands should be on top of the plus. Yes. I think double A_. Yep. The most ordinary uh batteries. Yep. I think about twenty minutes. I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever. Yeah, yeah, that's good one, yep. Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually, because television and beer is not a rare combination. Yes. Yep. No, that's true. Yeah. Yeah, a swapable front or whatever. Yeah. Yes, definitely, definitely. Yes, it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room. As I uh as I said during my presentation, fifty percent uh o Yeah. A face? Or uh yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean, yep. If you do that, but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros. I in in the base we could like make uh a button, and if you push it, the remote control itself s makes noise. That's probably stupid, but uh as I found here uh, fifty percent, was it fifty? Uh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control. No uh, of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in. If an a button in in that uh Yeah, you can ma make rechargeable one, yeah. Why not. It should only cost twelve and a half Euros, of course. Aye? Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yes. Yes, definitely. Yeah. Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts, of course. I don't know. On the other hand, if you don't do it, we can also make a nice bay. I mean, it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it, but um I think the bay is definitely uh Sure, why not. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. With eye candy, ear candy, whatever. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Definitely, yeah. It would be nice, yes. Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty, so yes. Yeah, why not. Hmm. No, that's true. Why not. Bleep bleep bleep, oh there it is, yeah. Yeah. No. Nearly. Yeah. Something like that, yeah. Oh. We'll see. Maarten, five minutes. No, that's true uh, yeah. Should we by the way draw um on our nice whiteboard, um a little uh idea of yeah. I dunno. Has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape? I don't, for one. A bit bigger I guess, but The shape is nice, it's um something different, and we want we want that. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah, but twelve and a half Euros? Uh Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Something like that is very ergonomic. So Yeah. Yes, volume and programme should be there I guess, because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part. Yeah, and the numbers on top, I guess. Maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry. Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah. I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then. Yeah. Yes, we are. Alright. Yes, I guess it's lunch time. I don't know. Half and hour? I thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour. I don't know about the lunch break. Well
Speaker B: Okay. Everybody ready? Welcome at the functional design meeting, again presented by Maarten. Uh this is the agenda, the opening. Uh, we've got three presentations. And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me. And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions. We have uh forty minutes. Oh, well this is the the closing already. So uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then. Uh, I think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order. Maybe the Well, it Oh that. It won't doesn't Maybe we should start with the the technical functions. Yeah? Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder. You've already done that? Well let's close this one. We'll just uh open a new one. Uh, well. Yes. Uh-oh. New thing. Oh yeah, uh I have to say something. Uh, due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes. But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time. And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too. Okay. Okay. Okay. But it's the technical side of the remote control. Oh. Okay. Well, we'll we'll have to skip that part then. But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control? It's gonna be easy? Okay. Yeah. M Okay. R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement. Doesn't really matter. Okay. Yeah, okay. Okay. Well, we'll see. We'll see later on. No. Well, uh will there be some uh user requirements later on? The ones I I've uh received from the account manager. Yeah. Well, we'll keep this in mind, and then discuss it later on. Uh-huh. Okay, but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote. we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v Yeah? Well, what that's what you want trying to say. Okay. Okay. Yeah, well some of these Uh, yeah. Well, some of that will Yeah, but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements. So Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market. Okay. Visually presents. Okay. Well, then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important. Uh, well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant, I think. Because um uh s decided to put They have decide to put two additional requirements forward. Well, now I see four. That's kinda strange. Well, they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet. Well, I think that may be so, but well, we can't just leave the teletext button off. It's impossible, I think. So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button, you know, like on and off, and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or You know, it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext, but not to play with it that much. So we have to think of that. The remote control should only be used for television. Otherwise, the project becomes more complex, which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market. So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely. I don't know. I think that uh that's what they're trying to say. Uh, our current customers are within the age group of forty plus. New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty. So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested. But, well, they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger Yeah, but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about, we already cover that. Our company already sells remote control to the older people, but we we also want, you know, a new customer group. That's the one we haven't covered yet. So I think that's what the problem is. We haven't got remote controls for uh Well I think, yeah. Yeah, I think so. Maybe if it's no no, but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants. So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group, but isn't that bad for an older person either. Uh, our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products. Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design. Okay, something else nice to know. Sorry? Yeah, you will have to look that up. I think it's something about the Oh, okay. I thought it w might be, let's make things better or something, but Okay well, let's go back to the the agenda. So we've now had to the three presentations. We know about the new project requirements. That means we can uh well d yeah, discuss on the remote control functions. Well, if I can uh make a start, I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be, and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it. I think we're we're looking for some Yeah, we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions. Y well, that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. M yeah, that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me, I think they are are c are contradicting each other, because they want a simpler design, and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_, but they s do aim at a younger Well, ma But I think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the, know, th th in functions you have Y Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room, like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player. You can uh, know, you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the, you know, audio settings and uh v uh screen settings. We don't want that. I think that was that became clear. We don't want. But w maybe we should put some func uh, I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to, you know, they want to uh control, remotely. No, yeah, th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to But maybe w Yeah. I think we maybe should Yeah, well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it. But just the basic functions. Maybe like rewind and wind, or n what d what do you guys think? Yeah, if as far as possible. But what do you think? Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices? No, you don't think so? Yeah, the new requirements say so. Well, maybe it's maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control. You know, a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with Yep, exactly. That's that's wha No no, you don't No no, you don't need it. No, no. Okay, but we have to think uh w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh, I guess, so um but uh from my experience it's kinda a lot of D_V_D_ players, you know, like forwarding, goes differently. Uh, you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed. It's c sometimes a bit difficult. Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh Well, I was thinking about putting it in, but concerning the project requirements and what you just said, I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then. And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one. If you want to keep it simple, you can make a universal remote. Okay. It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table, and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch, you pick up the the the nice remote, the simple one, just to put on the television, nothing more. Okay. Um, but what televis Yeah, we we'll make w this one trendy. And simple. Well, we we will come to that, but ju first on the on the functions. So we should put uh zap buttons on it. Um, also numbers, to uh to go to the specific channels. Uh, Okay, a t a teletext button should be there. But just one big teletext button, on and off. Probably. Oh, okay. Yeah, but uh I think that becomes too difficult, it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then. Yeah, yeah, but maybe you s yeah yeah, maybe y you do, but I've never heard of it in the first place. And we have to well t yeah, and t and teletext is becoming outdated. We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably. Yeah. I don't know. I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote. I don't know what you th guys think. Yeah, but do you like to have a such a s stop button? Or do you think it uh I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function. Yeah. Okay, it goes Yeah, but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now. That's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements. Well yeah uh, lots of new televisions can store pages, you know, and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it. Then we meet uh the new requirements. we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design, I guess. Okay. Um, well, what functions do we have to decide on? Or do we uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want. We have the zap and uh the volume. Should we do m make them very big? The the the zap button. D d Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also. Or maybe you should place them on a uh, in a special way? Yeah, something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah, and quick. You have to use it very quickly. Yeah, and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace. Oh, what should we decide on then? I think in a in a case of this simple remote control, the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already, but it w shouldn't be a problem then. Yep. No, okay, but we don't have to uh, when we don't want to uh control other devices, I think it makes it even more simple. I think I think that we should use uh d yeah, not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh Well, it has to be simple, and I wi Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house, you know. Oh. How much time do we ha we have left uh? M m m more than thirty minutes? Uh ten twenty minutes. Well, uh these these shouldn't Yeah. Yeah, okay. But that's that's Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that? How we can what the extra touch can be. Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or Well, it was something about how we lose them. Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Nah, um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things. It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone, and it is i has something nice. Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it, or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener. Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control. I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control, we have to do something to make it special. It's gonna cost twenty five Euros. Yeah, but the well, it's already been done. Nah. Yeah, that's true. But and I think it's gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something, so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something. it has to be used something special, and you really it has to, you know y not s people, when they buy it, they have to think, well this one lasts for a long time. We're really gonna use them. Not some thing you you throw away next week, you know. So maybe uh that's i I think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions, know, basic functions, uh it's very important to find something like this. So there's a very important task for you. And maybe we can all think about it. Uh, also for you maybe, when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy, and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well, you know. So big buttons, flashy design, and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing. Uh-huh. Yeah, or just different colours would be uh I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control. It could be be Yeah, you never know, but But it and I think we have to make it quite big. Yeah, people So, and and also because uh it is expensive. If you want it to be something, you know, it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it l make it Mm-hmm. And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table. I I think you m might wanna put it uh yeah, that it it it it stands up. Yeah, you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table. no no, put stuff inside it. But, it's like like a statue or something Yeah yeah, but yeah, but you also can put it somewhere near the window in That it's it's fashionable. I I don't Oh, yeah. Yeah, but but when you when it gets lost, how can you press the button to make it Oh, okay. Uh, that's kind of nice. And then also you don't even need batteries, because you can make it uh chargeable. Yeah, that w yeah, but yeah, the pro No, well I think that it might be t p Well, nee but we don't Yeah. Maybe you, but we don't know much about production cost, but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control, then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know, rechargeable units. Yeah, but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So, it's not gonna be that expen Uh I I think it's a great idea. S some kind of be I've never seen that before, and you make it uh um be uh, you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays. Well, I well it's really ch you can recharge it, so you ha never have the battery problem. That's one. And uh you can always find your remote control up Uh, okay. Well, maybe yeah, you could when that's when it's too costly, you could probably skip the recharger, but you will you do need uh also an uh, also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well, you know. Does it makes it kinda Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it. Yeah. I think it's a good idea. And make it, you know, we we um Well, we uh it's it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control. We can save on the on the functions. We just put some simple button in, make it big and sturdy, nothing more, and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make, or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up, it's also nice. And if you put it away, I think it's uh w we have to we uh that's uh it's not a easy market. We have to something special. And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control, and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions, because we aren't gonna put Yeah. And then uh when make it, you know, nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing. Yeah. I think I think it's a good idea. Yeah. Oh, if it let's well, we will see what's possible concerning the the costs, and if it's possible we'll do that. And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing. And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something. If that's too expensive, we won't do that. But it would be nice. It's the idea. I know that batteries last long nowadays. And and what people just think about, well, I'll never have to buy any r batteries again, so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty. And you know then when you haven't batteries around, and probably for two weeks, your remo I've experienced that that Yeah, okay. So, easy functions. Well, we will we will I think we'll work that out, zapping, numbers on it, bi Yeah. But it's also annoying. 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working, you're not very motivated to do something about it. Then it beeps all the time and. You don't want to have ever have those problems, and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable. And you don't have to use the unit, you can also put it on the side if people don't like it. Uh, i i in the in the ma Yeah, but it w I mean, if if they pay for it because they think, oh, that's a great idea, I'm gonna use it. And when it, you know, when time goes by and they think, well, I'll never put him in the recharger, I think last long enough, then they put it on side and they can use it now and then. Then when they look get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control, within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control, they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh, I think it's brilliant. Yeah, I've never it's so simple, but I've never seen it. M maybe we should really do this. Okay now, well, how much time have we got left? These clocks aren't uh synched. Oh, now I've put uh well, it is twenty p Okay, so we have ten minutes or something? Yeah, but we're uh we're done. I think. We've decided on the functions. Well, there is some oh. There is a closing sheet. We have lunch break, and then we have thirty minutes of individual work. Oh okay, I'll make sure I'll I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes, the the s the next minutes won't be a problem, but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too, but maybe it won't work, but you'll see. I think these are more important than the first ones, so. Oh, five minutes. Yeah, because uh I I d I did uh the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy, you know. Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout, which I could uh, know, use for the other ones well, but uh I d think uh I forgot to do put done under the first one, and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something. And then you you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know. Becau I d uh, it was not my uh pen. this kind of looks you like. Of the shape. Yeah, probably, it would be nice. No, bigger. Well, I I I have to say, I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all, or I think some maybe we should no, that will be too costly. We shou we could also, that was a would also be an idea, but I don't think it I don't know if it exists already, you should like make Alessi or something design it. That would also be nice. But that's gonna then you c then you don't Yeah, but then you don't have t yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time, you know s was it's a single cost. Yeah, m but but then you can nah, I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive, because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive. Would be a nice idea though. I don't know. I think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something. Like something like that or so or so And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it. It's also round. Put it in there uh wire on it. Maybe uh, I don't know, some some lights, a big but well. Volume and programme, yeah. And some of the extra funct Some of the extra functions over here. Numbers. And and lights? How we're g well, maybe uh s a ring of no, no, you have to Maybe on the side of it. Along the side uh strip of yeah. Yeah, but I also meant the the blinking li w you know, the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote. Well, theys have to be Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Exactly. When you you see it from the side, then it would look just like that. And then you have a strip of uh lights or something. Well, uh I think it's nice, for one thing. maybe put something on top of it or, you know, like that's looks funny. I don't know. Or some bump. Maybe some Yeah? We'll have to think about it. I think we're we're done. We can save this one. Mm mm. Yeah, that was what uh Mm, we'll hear about it.
Speaker C: Here we go again. Oh. Okay. Mm, okay. Yeah, it's okay. Okay. No. In project. No can that open. Open it there. Okay. About the get Okay. But nothing restricted for user interface? With technical I don't know. 'Kay. Okay. But I kind of uh Yes. Uh Well, the technical functions. Um, well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got, but uh I got these two, and I think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user. th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements, I don't s uh know who's doing t Yeah, but it I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control. Yeah, well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah, when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it. Well, yeah w if you want try a a a huge market, if you want to reach a huge market, uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user. But I don't know. It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use. Yeah, probably, yeah. Uh well, there are l at least uh basic functions, uh like just th the channels uh one till nine, uh on and off switch, which must be clear with a red button or something like that. Um, most standard uh have volume, of course, and a mute function, and, of course, the next and previous channel. I think that's just basic what we need. And from that on we can user requirements what we need more. Uh Yeah, I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets, and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions, more buttons, maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that. M you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that. I don't know. Uh, I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh yeah, more trendier design, I think. I think. Yeah? Uh, well, that's all I have to say, I think. Yeah, that was it.. Okay. Well No way. Yeah. But what's our slogan? The slogan uh Puts fashion in electronics. Sense simplicity. Yeah. Yeah, but wha But Yeah, but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used. So why should j we put this function in? I think more I think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions. Yeah, but uh you said Yeah, d yeah, but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making. It's n Yeah. Yeah. No. No, new requirements say no. So Yeah, but I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control, they use their own th th with lot more functions. No, no. Exactly. Mm, yeah. Yeah, but just keep it simple and look more at th No. It's only for television. So Yeah. Yeah, nothing more. Exactly. Yeah. The user interface is easy. And the basic yeah, basic functions, yeah. It's too much integrated in the other. Yeah. Will you look Look at the market. Well Yeah, I uh, it's Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah, for the soccer uh Well, uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um, a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights, and there are a lot of flights in one page, so if if th Yeah, but True. A simple yeah. But trendy, yeah. I don't know. Original. It was uh True. Yeah. Maybe uh Uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe. If you use large batteries or small batter batteries. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Early break. To find him. That's maybe yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but that's yeah. Yeah. Be original, yeah. Mm-hmm. And use friendly, yeah. Yeah. Must brain-storm. Well Why not? More money for us. Yeah. Quite big. Yeah, you think? A standard or something. It's like you have uh four phones. Something like that. On the television. Oh, like this. A char chargeable. Yeah. Why not. Production. It should be possible. I think it's a good idea. To make a base or something? It's it's it's it's it's not the purpose to be handy, it's Mm. Yeah, but that's not it's ugly, I think. No. Yeah. True. Yeah. Yeah, it must be must be a gadget to have. Yeah. Yeah, we c Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down. Yeah. true. Yeah. Yeah. And you can leave it just there. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I'll Uh fifteen minutes. Can you make an uh uh a part of f folder for the minutes maybe? That not not everything in one one uh folder. Yeah. Maybe. Or the sh Do you get an idea of the shape? A little bit bigger, yeah but Oh, uh look uh look at the pictures. Yeah, flash lights at the side. At the side, or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, side of it. Just two LEDs or something on the side. Yeah. Yeah. Well, uh probably at the side. You know look at the front, but Yeah, exactly, and then there is yeah. Yeah, something like that, yeah. No. No. Bumper or something. Yeah. Lunch break. Okay then. Okay, five uh Oh..
Speaker D: My mouse is not working anymore. He's uh when I put it in, is is going to beep beep beep. Huh. Okay, how can I get this on the whiteboard? Okay, I've done that. Yes. 'Kay, we're going to um uh talk about working design. Um, the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy, it activates a chip uh in the remote. It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television. Mm, it's a nowadays very uh known, a known uh uh technology. Um, the known technology can make a cost very low. Uh, it's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world. And and the components are very uh very cheap. Um, Uh, diodes, uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights, they're needed and they're uh everywhere available. Uh, again, it's a fair price. It's a common uh technology uh, like I told um Uh, the circuit board, it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control. Uh, we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires, it's it is uh can be made as fast as printing paper. It's uh it's all very uh Yeah, they're making it uh all the time. Uh, and it's not uh very specialised uh technology. I haven't come to here, but um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls. They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows. So I don't know uh why I should put it here. Uh Yes, but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time. But What? No. Yes. Um, no, it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology, yeah. Remote control is nothing special nowadays. Um I don't think so, because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions, but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote? No. But you can put them under the same button. But you can put a play and stop and and rewind. Yes, but we Huh. Yes, but there are there are But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market? There are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have Yes, but you could put on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages. If you have seven pages, you can go up and down. Yes. Yes. Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick. But No, it's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest. No. The most standard batteries. But i in a way we have to be uh uh special. Maybe th m For the remote control. That's to be uh a formed for your hand. More like a joystick then. But that's that's fun for the first time, and then the second Or you can Yeah. With recharger. Yes, but is that handy? But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years, three years, with with t two batteries. And then you Yes. Or But you pay for it. Maybe like this pen. It has to feel nice in your hand.","The project manager opened the meeting. The industrial designer reported on working design, explaining how a remote control works and describing its main components. The user interface designer talked about what functions should be included. He suggested they should focus on either expert or novice users. The basic functions should include an on/off switch, buttons for channels one to nine, volume, mute and buttons for next and previous channel. He suggested that a trendy design should not have many buttons. The marketing expert reported on user requirements, including how users rated the importance of different features. He stressed that a trendy design is important, that users zap a lot, and that remotes often get lost. The project manager informed the group of new requirements. The remote is only for TV, should not include a teletext feature, and should feature the company colour and slogan. The group discussed what functions and features the remote should have, and whether to include DVD/VCR controls, a teletext button, stop button, changeable covers, and a base/recharger with locator function. The group also discussed making the remote a rounded, ergonomic shape, and using flashing lights to help locate it when lost."
132,"Speaker A: Yeah. Mm-hmm. So right now? Mm. It's reasonable, I think, yeah. Those things just refer to each of each of us, I think. AMI and okay. Okay. Okay, and Marketing Expert, it's me. You can manage all this, yeah. Good. Um. Not really. So which you, the Industrial Designer. Okay. Yeah. I mean, you have to know. Ah, you have to know it. It's your job, so I hope you you know what it is. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Well. You know. Oh, okay, okay. Not the other one. Yeah, I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer. Mm. Mm-hmm. And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty, so. That's the problem. Mm. It's clear. Yeah, maybe should go and draw an animal. Many Yeah. Uh it's the same as mine. It's the fat cat, okay. A rat? That's difficult. Yeah. Just go, you you the closest to the whiteboard. Jus Yeah. A duck. Pikachu. Oh yeah. Bugs Bunny one. Okay. I go. What? Oh. So what else? This was my favourite one, but Right. A fish. Oh yeah, doesn't look so fine. Okay, it's your turn. Mm. Good. I think it's done. Yeah. Oh, we have twenty five minutes for the meeting. Okay. Know what time is it? No. Good.
Speaker B: Ah okay. It's Ada Longmund? Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard, yeah? Yeah, I don't know. I it's it's reasonable, s quite yeah. Twenty five. Is Yeah. I I hope so I_D_ is for the Industrial Design, yeah? And U_I_D_, it's for the User Interface Designer, yeah? AMI yeah project. you will be the manager yeah. I am the Industrial Design, yeah I am the Industrial Designer so. It's difficult. You know very soon. So I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the uh industrial design, it is how the object will look like. Yeah. So the materi Okay right. But I was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be, you know. But I don't know. Okay. I'm the industrial designer. So. Okay. So and the marketing expert will Ok Okay. It should be There was a step about drawing something in the in the board, I don't know. Is it? Are we supposed to do right now? Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri It's I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now. Oh Everybody I think everybody should do it, so. It's not matter So. yeah. It's a It's a cat. It is not a fat cat. Yeah, it is a Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat. It's your rat. Okay, go right, but in grow, it's everybody has to grow What are you I don no idea, so It's a rabbit. It's not so bad so. So you don't have a A fish. That's a that's a fish? Okay, let's try to draw something. Have to be really careful. Ah it's my turn. Okay. So. It's ok So, what can I draw some more?? No. Mm Yeah, it's it's a se it's my priority this one. Yeah. No. It's a really crazy dog Okay. Transfer. It's a dog in a village. So what are you sug going to do now? It's done? Oh my God. Yeah, it's okay. We have an idea yeah. I have an idea of my job so yeah so. Yeah.
Speaker C: So we can start? Suppose I have to do my presentation. Eh um So, I'll present myself, I'm Ada Longmund, and as you may know it, I'm the pr project manager. So um we will have to um speak about m the project. Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control, so the remote control has to be original, trendy and um user-friendly. Record. So the project method is the following. So if we're um the functional design, you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other. Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design. Uh. The tool training is to try out the white board, so Maybe you can draw your favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics. I don't know if we have to do it now, maybe later later. So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's quite good price, yeah. And uh it will uh be a an international remote control, as we want to sell it in the entire world, and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes. So, as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control. Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls, try to create something new and people would like to to buy. And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes, so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do. And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications. Yeah. I_D_, yeah. So So I will manage all all the group. So you have questions? So you all know what the parts of the work you have to do. Mm-hmm. And you? Mm okay. Hmm. I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it. And i maybe you will transform it. Maybe, it is the outside and the inside. And yeah. And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product. So you don't have to do something really specific, as everybody everybody will have to use it, it's sor the same as keyboards. You know, you have Qwerty, Azerty, French and U_K_ keyboard, so really the remote control to be international. And not too expensive. As we want to maximise the benefit. Yeah, you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros. And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now. So, is it okay? So you think we have to do it now? You want me to draw something? Product manager okay, let's go, I will try. No. A mouse is not too difficult. Mouse is okay. You love the eyes. Yeah, that was the eyes. A clown. Rabbit. It's a rabbit. Yeah. Thank you. You forgot the chips. Fish and chips. Of Oh.? Oh yeah. Yeah, I think yeah. Just have to present project, discuss a little bit about it. Yeah. So, if you have questions. It's okay? You know your job? you know your job? You know your job? Okay.
Speaker D: So yeah I think you can do it. Twenty five Euros? Yep. Yeah. That's me. Okay. Yeah. No I'm user interf I'm user interface design. Okay. So what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design? Yeah, I think so. Okay, so I make uh u user interface. You you de you implement the core functions in the Use it. Make make yeah. Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh, it's the function design. I design the user f user interface, you design the function. Yeah. Okay. Yeah yeah. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And uh simple. And easy to use. Ah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah yeah, you try. Try first. You can draw something which is very simple. Oh, maybe we should bring Kemy here. Kemy is really good at drawing. You're going to draw? Okay. What's this? It's a fat cat. Can you draw uh um rabbit? Oh, hat ha rat. Yeah. Yeah, it's okay. Mm. Okay. Oh. Okay, I draw. The only thing I can draw is like this. Oh. Oh. Oh. No. What's this? Okay. Okay. The only thing I can draw, because it's very simple. Oh. Okay, be careful. No problem, no problem.. A person? Dog. Okay. Okay. So we have break. Oh. Hmm. No. Okay.",The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and discussed the roles of each member and the selling price for the remote they will produce. Then the team participated in an exercise in which they all drew animals.
17,"Speaker A: Are you gonna take the minutes? Good. Hello. Um I don't, do you have an extra copy? Thanks. Okay. Mm-hmm. Sure. Okay, so the previous movies that we've done this year were Lawrence of Arabia, Apop Apocalypse Now and Amadeus, which were all historical, serious, dramatic and somewhat actiony movies. So for this month I propose doing something different, preferably something set in the present, um something maybe dramatic but slightly less serious. So what I'd propose is actually a thriller or a mystery. And while these days people are so jaded by general movies that they tend not to be surprised by the endings in mysteries, some movies in the nineties did actually have twists that people came out saying, never saw that coming, I didn't know that that was gonna happen. And so what I'm gonna do is present you two of those movies, and before anyone says that, well, if you know th how the movie ends, you're not gonna wanna see it again, that's not necessarily the case, because a lot of people like to re-watch movies um to see where the clues were, what they missed, things they didn't pay attention to the first time around. Um so if you can go to the next slide. What I'd propose is either The Usual Suspects or The Sixth Sense. Um The Usual Suspects is slightly less mainstream. Um is has a fairly large cast, notably Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, um and it was directed by Bryan Singer, it's one of his earlier movies I think. It was written by Quist Christopher McQuarrie. Um and according to Rolling Stone it's the freshest, funniest and scariest crime thril thriller to come along since Pulp Fiction. Uh The Sixth Sense on the other hand is a more commercial movie with its famous line, I see dead people. Um it was written and directed by M_ Night uh Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette, and it's about a little boy who sees dead people and i he sees a child psychologist to try to get him to understand why he sees the dead people, what it means. Now that you've given away the twist, yes. Um Yeah. Send your complaints to Rolling Stone. So on the next couple of slides I'll just go through some of um more detailed stuff that we might need for administrative purposes. Um the length for The Usual Suspects um is a hundred and five minutes. Uh as you can s well, as Andrei already said, it's n nineteen ninety five. It has an R_ rating, which means that at least in the in North America it was not recommended for people under eighteen, 'cause it's fairly violent, but not so violent as other movies. Um plot outline uh five villains in New York are rounded up by the police in an unconventional manner that worries them. After release they get together for a spot of revenge, but someone else is controlling events. And the big mystery of the movie is who's controlling the events. Um it got an eight point seven out of ten user rating on the Internet Movie Database, it's sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty movies of all time, forth in Denis's list of the top movies of the nineteen nineties, which I think was also taken from I_M_D_B_. Um it won several Academy Awards, including best supporting actor and best writing, um best film for the British equivalent of the Academy Awards, it was nominated for a Cesar for best foreign film. So it got a fair bit of recognition despite not being um a very mainstream, high budget movie, or maybe because it wasn't a mainstream, high budget movie. I don't think a lot of people have seen it, in fact, other than you haven't seen it, you haven't seen it, you've seen it. And don't think a lot of people have seen it, it's not a very very well known movie. What? Is it? See? Really? That surprises me, I always got the impression that it was Yeah. Well, it's a good movie. Yeah. Yeah. So but I think the main thing is it's got a good twist at the end and it's it's an interesting movie to watch. Um so if you go to the next slide. More or less the same thing for The Sixth Sense. It's slightly newer, nineteen ninety nine, more or less the same amount of time. It has a lower rating, 'cause it's less violent, but it depends what audience we are gonna have at the showings. It has it's scary and I think it has some sort of slight violence, but. Yeah, but they're not violently dead. It's it's morbid and it's creepy, but it's not violent as in people being sliced in half or anything like that. Um um it's nineteenth in the top movies of the nineties, hundred first in the top two hundred fifty, it was nominated for a lot of awards, it didn't win as many. Might have won more sort of minor awards, but at least the Academy Awards, it was nominated for five of them, um but didn't win. Nevertheless still a good movie, still a good twist at the end, which Denis already gave away. Good. Um so those would be my two choices. Let it's a sort of different style from the other movies we've seen, and they have a twist, so it's not your general movie where you just kind of sit through it and go, oh okay, get up and leave. It's at least out of those two movies I came out thinking, oh cool, okay. Yeah, but I mean that's a good thing, right? Yes. Yeah. Which is a good marketing ploy, if you think about it. Yeah, Bruce Willis is and the kid is really good, who plays the the main character. Yeah, yeah. Same guy. No. I've heard a lot of really good things about it, but Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think it's about three hours long, something like that. And it's a heavy movie, I it's emotional, it's I think it did. Either for director if not for best picture. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, I've seen it. Yeah, yeah, that was his comeback movie, yeah. Yeah. It's Uma Thurman, yeah. Uh maybe 'cause I_M_D_B_ is updated daily, so if it happens that people had voted for it Mm-hmm. Have you? But it is this movie. Ah okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. No, it's later than that, isn't it? Yeah. I don't know, but it was a good performance, creepy. Yeah. I think so, yeah. When did it come out? Yeah. As are we all. Yeah, me too. I don't think I've seen it since then. Ah. No, on the seco uh second one. Yeah. It wasn't that good, but I think it was almost more disgusting in a way There were some scenes in it where normally I don't get queasy watching movies, but that was just too much. It might be a little bit too violent for I dunno. Yeah. That's a good movie. Yeah, it's Kevin Spacey. Quite possibly, yeah. Yeah. Theoretically, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Morgan Freeman. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well let's go through the other suggestions. I do. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Up close. Yeah. It's very different, I don't think you can compare them. Also sets the mood a little bit. Darker and Yeah, but you'd get a different impression if you had bright blue sky and bright sunshine behind it. Mm-hmm. Yeah, he's private Ryan. Well They're being sent to the front behind enemy lines to retrieve one soldier only because all of his other brothers died. Most of them get killed, don't they? Yeah. Yeah. Mm-mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I tried to. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Or is that the other Lebowski? Oh, okay. Buscemi, yeah. Really? Mm-hmm, yeah. I think it looks too much like a C_D_ cover, though. I like the layout of the first one and the content of this one. It looks like two different posters though. It's hard to read. The paragraph I think was a little bit long. I would and content of the second one. Yeah. Yeah, like what you have there. And then maybe replace the paragraph that you had on the first poster with either shorter sort of descriptions, not even of the whole plot, but just descriptions of the movie or 'cause I think that paragraph is too long, people don't r generally just stand there and then read the whole thing. Mm-hmm. It's here, forty eight. I hope more people have seen it. Mm-hmm. Um I'd go for Sixth Sense, just because it's different from all the other ones and maybe Shawshank Redemption, just because we haven't seen it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, um Okay. Okay, um So I'll I'll give two to American Beauty and mm one to The Big Lebowski. Okay, so it's pretty clear. American Beauty. Well you can keep the format, I mean th you didn't have that many graphics in the first one. Yeah. Okay. Yes, but of the wrong movie. That's the real twist. No, she's not. No, it's who is it? Annette Bening, who's the m the main character, the well, the main female character, the mother. When do you want these images by? Just quickly. Day after tomorrow? Two thousands. Third isn't it? Monday May third? We can ask people casually, sort of what genre of movie they want, or Start again. Or go back to the fifties. Okay. American Beauty.
Speaker B: Yep. Um So hello everybody. So uh you everybody had the a agenda for today, you received it or Yep. So the goal for today is to decide for a movie to project at the end of the month, so for this month of of April, and also discuss the content for an adver advertising posters and um I I will present you three des different design, we'll discuss it. So first we have to decide for um a movie. So I think we all prepared documents. So I propose that we start with uh presentation Agnes uh sent. And actually the psychologist is dead. Yep. Mm. Yep. So wha what will be your argument for projecting this movie? Yep. It's very well known. Yeah. I think, yeah. It's one of the most well known thriller.. Yeah. That's my impression, yeah. But it's it's rated four fourth in uh in the list and one hundred one hundred thousand seen it. Voted for it. Voted for it, and I think only two other mov uh no, f three other movies uh have uh have more votes. But the kid is seeing dead people, I mean is uh it's quite uh No, but it's quite uh morbid you can say that? Yeah, morbid. Yeah. They don't remember. Yep. So what was you criteria for selecting this movie or But then it's only at the at the end that it it becomes a good movie. Only because of the of the end. I I've heard some people in the in the theatre saying, oh now we have to see it again. But then if you asked them five minutes ago okay. Yeah. Okay, so uh I think, Mirek, you prepared a presentation also. We can have a look. Sorry, it's control L_ I have s I have seen it, but I don't remember it. Which is not good.. But the rating is very good then. It you know if it's to uh if it received some award? Or Probably no? Yeah, I think also but uh Yeah yeah. Well, it's a true story also, uh so. And to remember maybe, or Yeah. So who has seen it? Agnes, you've seen it? Yeah. And it's it's the comeback from of uh John Travolta, no? So uh Big comeback, yeah. Bruce Willis is there also. Yeah. Um Sorry? And what's the name of the girl on the poster. Um Uma Thurman, okay. Yep. So on the list I I brought on the docu on my document, the two movies, Pulp Fiction and Usual Su Suspect are just swapped. Pulp Fiction is actually coming before The Usual Suspect. Yeah, Tuesday, it's quite surprising though, but uh, okay. Yeah. Actually I have seen it, now I realise, yeah, yeah. No, because I thought it was like another movie, but it's it's this movie actually. Uh Les in French. I think it that one, but it's very violent. Very. It doesn't say it here, but uh it's probably rated R_. It speak about uh a guy who is not Italian, who is uh going up in the hierarchy of mafia. So. The mob, so the mob is the mafia actually? Okay. And Jodie Foster is very good as well. She was pretty young, no? For. W w from whe when is the movie? Ninety one, yeah. Yep. But not that good, no? Okay, what's your opinion? You have seen it? Violent and and uh scary as well. Mm. Psychopathic, I mean it's uh Okay. And last choice. Yep, that's a good one. And Kevin Spacey? It's no, Kevin Spacey, he received something, no? He's actually uh quitting his job at the beginning, but he's uh simulating a fight with his boss in order to to to pursue pursue to Yeah, I think. Yeah, to sue him afterward. And then Yeah. Yeah. Yep. No uh there is this rose, because the she's he's imagining her taking baths with ro roses all around and uh he's uh yeah. Exactly. Okay. Um so what will be your favou your preferred one on in this list? The first one, yeah. Probably yeah, you received so yeah. Yeah, yeah. And it's uh Tim Robbins and uh who is the the guy behi Morgan Freeman. Yeah. Yeah, great actors. Mm yeah. Yep. Okay. Yep, it tells something. Okay, it's just a do we want to have to display the most popular movie or or we're Yeah. That's right, yeah. Okay, Andrei, yeah, can can you comment your Yeah. Um yeah, I w thank you. Yep. And you e And you enjoyed that, the fact the you see clo I To realise how it wa how it was exactly. Yeah, it's very different, yeah. To make it like uh an historical movie or Yeah, mm. Oh. Yeah. What kind of message? Sorry, I'm not getting your Okay. Yep. Or or we have you have Okay. So actually I don't know if uh y any of you have uh read the document I prepared on The Big Lebowski. It's below the table, yeah. I wanted Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I wanted to say that uh it's quite open, there are many choices possible. But then my proposal is The Big Lebowski from um the two brothers uh Coen, Coen brothers. And it's a actually Joel Co Coen who uh directed the movie. Um the plot is quite hard to to make, but maybe you you read it al already you understood something from the plot or. I am? Yeah, it's it's it's a bit like the f in my opinion like um American Beauty, because it's it's a funny movie but uh it critiques a lot the American society. And the the the hero, the the Dude, the mm Big Lebowksi, it's actually his name, is a a kind of non-hero, but he's representative of the of uh a normal uh L_A_ L_A_ guy. And uh he has a friend comi veter veteran from Vietnam and uh another friend who is never speaking. And they all are together in a bowling club where they meet and they discuss about uh everything. They seems to have no job, I not know, we never seen i them working. Yeah. And actually he's uh taking part to a kind of um uh uh s some some killers come to his apartment uh because they think he's someone else, and uh the whole story is about uh he wants to to to get some money out of this story, and he's going to see the other Lebowski to ask him money, because he he because the killers actually uh damage some stuff in his apartment. It's uh Jeff Bridges and uh John Goodman. John Goodman, you have probably seen him in in a series? On the right, the guy on the right, Jeff Bridges. Yeah. He's the one coming uh from from Vietnam. He's kind of uh he is still equipped for for war. Okay so uh It's f a movie from the nineties actually, yep. Yep, yeah, yeah, that's a problem. I'm going to actually I want to show you some posters I prepared for this movie, so we actually can discuss at the same time the poster design. So on the left you see the main characters of the movie, so the the hero at the top left. Then it's the guy coming back from Vietnam. Afterward it's uh uh a guy who John Turturro, they are competing with him on a bowling uh contest, and um Julianne Moore and the last one is Buscemi or something like that. Buscemi? He's never speaking in the movie. Each time he's trying to speak, the other one are are stopping him. So it's qu No, he's not on the on the picture, the second Lebowski. So uh my proposition was to add um the title of course, some information abo about the pricing on the right Uh yeah, but when it will be printed it will be okay, I think. Ah, you mean Okay, so I prepared a second one where th th th there's there is some information. At the bottom we can see that um, do you know Mondre Montreux English Movie Club? Uh I said that people can contact us to to get to the committee and select movies. So um. Okay. But there is a th there is a third one. Um actually I I prefer it because it's more colourful also. But it's it can catch the eyes actually but um But then the problem I preferred the first one, because I think it's important to have the plot of movie, e especially for uh a movie people don't n never heard about it. But uh I don't know. Okay. Okay, so what do you propose, what should I do for these posters? In terms of content. Okay, I'll try to do something, but first anyway we have to select a movie. So I'll put all the information and you want me to put the at the bottom, all the information about the committee and the the Montreux Club, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so just to conti to finish with The Big Lebowski, it's um I think those two images are pretty representative, so the on the first on on the top you see the hero with a a cowboy that i introduces the movie, and on the bottom it's uh he is he keeps dreaming in th in this movie, because uh uh the killer's um uh put it d put it or he is drinking too much also, so each time he's uh drinking he's having some dreams, very very weird, but interesting. Yep. Yeah, yeah. Actually, she wants him to she wants to make kids and she's using the Big Lebowski to have kids with him, but he doesn't know. So maybe he's making strange uh Okay. Yeah, yeah, it's very very sweet and it's like a it's like a dream actually. It's um no, it is on in the table actually. It's um it's coming at the end. Forty eight. But quite a lot of people have seen it actually. Yeah. Yeah, but generally you vote when you have seen the movie, no? Okay, so uh I think we should decide for a movie now. So maybe each of us can s can select two movies or Okay. Um no, actually I'm happy with the choices, because I really I would really push uh American Beauty, because I think it's uh it's an easy movie to watch and and still there are a lot of things to think afterward. And it's representative of the nineties, I think. Okay. Yeah. Okay, start, Andrei. No I don't want to finish I think I'm going to No. Yeah, maybe it makes more sense, yeah. Okay, me I put two to American Beauty and uh one to Saving Private Ryan. No, Big Lebowski, I nominate. So do we have something? Yeah, that's the only thing that's worrying me, but it should be okay. Yeah, yeah. So you select you wanted actually me to select the this design? That takes a bit more time, but if you c if all of you can send me one image, I can make something on the left. Select one image from the movie and uh With a different title? Okay. No but I'll make something. Julianne Moore actually uh She's playing in the no? In American Beauty? Ah okay. Okay uh we s We still have to decide for next meeting and we're all set. Uh by uh Monday, next Monday. I think we can meet at the same period. Yeah. No. First Monday of May. Yep. But then in June, what are we going to do in June, because we cannot make movies from ten two thousand Yeah. yeah, maybe. Okay. Thank you. So what's the movie again? Okay. Thank you.
Speaker C: It's just that I need uh some some white paper. Uh yes. Um, hello? Yes, I did. Mm. Ah. No, but we're the clubbers, but Agnes, uh I was just wondering, uh I see uh I have here Denis's table, and when they say that it's the freshest whatever since Pulp Fiction, well that's probably not a very long time, because Pulp Fiction is ninety four and Usual Suspects is ninety five. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I haven't seen it. Really? Oh. It's it's hard to tell. So that's your impression. Yeah. That's mine, but uh Yeah. How many people voted for it, yeah? That's true. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Isn't violent at all in fact, or it's more like scary or Uh-huh. Scary or yeah, mm-hmm. Creepy or Mm-hmm. Have you seen it? Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Ah. If we show it twice. Okay. So is Bruce Willis the child psychologist? Ah. Great. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's the guy who then played in uh Artificial Intelligence or something like this, mm-hmm. Great. Mm. Uh me neither. I thi So uh I was told that in French it was called uh Les Evadees. Yeah. Should we should we believe this? Mm-hmm. Yeah, maybe even best picture, yeah. Mm-hmm. But yeah, indeed, it's maybe too sad and too, yeah, too poignant for Well Mm-hmm. Yeah, I've seen it too. Yeah it's it's very good and it's a bit violent, but it's also quite funny I think. It's a Mm-hmm. Yeah. the boxer. Pardon? Yeah, as the boxer. Uh Uma Thurman. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's strange, with so many votes that they can p shift. I mean statistically speaking it's strange. Mm-hmm. Wow. Mm. But it was that movie? Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Not really in favour of this, but Ah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think, yeah, when yeah, I saw this movie some time ago and yeah, she looked quite young I thought. Ninety one,. Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh yeah, I've seen it, yeah. Yeah, it's a good movie, I um I don't know, maybe too well known, but since it's fifteen years old maybe people would li Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh again? Mm-hmm. I see. S mm-hmm mm-hmm. Ah, that's the girl who is represented on the the picture? You recognise her belly? Uh Oh so you recognise the rose. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, but didn't I mean I see this name of the the director on the slide, but I don't really know him. Frank Darabont? Never heard of this guy. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm not sure. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, maybe. But it's true, yeah, we shouldn't stick to only very highly rated movies on this table. Though it's a very useful table, but um okay, do you want me to yeah. So yeah, uh I wrote some notes on um on Saving Private Ryan, which is my candidate. If you can display them it's perfect. Uh do you all have a copy of them? I have some paper copies. Uh you're welcome. So actually given that more or less our theme since the beginning of the year was um history, drama, action, and given also that, well, we decided to to present this month a movie from the the nineties, um I thought that among these movies, who look quite popular, uh Saving Private Ryan would be a very good candidate. Um actually it's a movie I've seen. Have you seen it before? Okay, so you've all seen it, so maybe everyone has seen it, I'm not very sure. Um but I think it's a very novel treatment of of war, it's uh it's no longer the b glorification of uh, whatever, combat and victory, but the plot is quite different, it's about saving one person who has a special special value in the in the movie um if only because his brothers actually were all killed, so uh the government believes that they should save at least one person from the family, and saving means actually removing from the the front, if you if re if you remember the plot. So in fact this guy, the Private Ryan is not at all the main actor, the the main a well, the main character is uh played by Tom Hanks and it's actually you can see his picture on the second page of my my notes uh Captain John Miller. So he is sent with this rather strange mission, which is not a combat mission, but they uh they want just to to get this guy back, which is in fact this guy is I think behind enemy lines or something like this. So it happens in in Europe, just after the the Normandy landing, and it's very very striking the way they they filmed all the the combat scenes and uh it's it's very dramatic, it's uh it's not, you know, like in the movies from the fifties or the sixties where people just fall and die anonymously, but here they well, you see everything and you see how many people die on that day. It's actually Well it's very strange, you could s ask this for any sad movie, did you enjoy it. Well I didn't really enjoy to see bad things, but uh I think it was satisfying to see that, well, how dramatic things are. Yeah. Exactly, yeah. I it's very moving, I it's true, it's not very it's not very, well, happy. I don't know how it would compare with Apocalypse Now, if it's darker or maybe Yeah. So yeah, so I think this would continue a bit our our theme. So the the movie is ranked quite high, if I if I refer back to your table it's number uh, what actually, um fourteen. Quite a lot of votes, so um also one of the the mainstream movies. Um on the second page uh of my notes I well I quoted some uh well some facts about the movie that I found interesting, we we could use them for either a poster or uh or a presentation. Um especially I enjoyed the story about the the colour saturation. It's true that the movie is not really black and white, uh but uh the colours are grey-ish, dark-ish, it it prov it makes a very moving effect. Yeah, I think also to show the um yeah, I think it's the reference to history and also this dark yeah the mood and uh things are actually well most of the things are quite grey, you know, the uniforms, weapons, things and things like that. Mm-hmm. Exactly. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well I think Matt Damon is the guy who must be saved, if I remember well, and in fact the die Well yeah, the people didn't understand why they should save one person. So and they are quite resentful, because they I mean they feel they should fight, they shouldn't just go there and uh just get someone and get back. And in fact some of them d get killed for this guy. Actually most of them, yeah, I think so. So Yeah, yeah. It's a very I think some people compare it with uh, whatever, Christian message or I dunno, but um I think it's quite quite universal and it's uh I think it's a modern, very modern Well this uh value of one individual, it looks like a Christian message, you know, the value of one is compared to others I I don't know I th I think I heard this at that point, but maybe I'm just wrong. So yeah, I I think it would make a coherent choice. It's probably a bit long and we might want something that is lighter and funnier, but uh if we want to keep this this idea of history and conflict and also to show some some kind of modern treatment of it, it it would make for a good choice. But if you see in my notes at the bottom of the first page I put some other candidate movies. Uh La Vita e Bella is an Italian one, but it's also about history and it happens at t the same period as Schindler's List. And I also quoted Pulp Fiction and Silence of the Lambs, um a bit more remote from the themes, but quite well known movies and enjoyable I would say. So do you have any questions about this, or should we just move to the next candidate maybe? Okay. It's just below the table, so since we all refer to the table Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, I think the summary is i is quite good, and especially I think it uh well mm when you read it you just want to go to see the movie. I think it looks funny for me. I haven't seen the movie, but uh the summary looks funny. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Actually, who are the two characters on the the p the poster, on the on the image that Uh-huh. And w and which one is the Big Lebowski on the picture? Okay, so the guy with the glasses. The Vietnam guy. Hmm. Well, sort of. Oh. Mm-hmm. Oh. Yeah, you cannot read it very well because Mm. Uh-huh. Yeah, the text on this one is very good. Oh because it's square. Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't like the black one. The f the first poster is I think much uh much too dark. No, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, maybe two or three sentences, because I guess they won't stop in front of the poster. Yep. So layout of the first one and colours of the third one. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh okay. So the woman on the second picture, that's Julianne Moore or oh. Ah. Interesting. So it's not really violent or I mean the movie is quite for general audiences. Okay. okay. Huh. Well, at least voted for it. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, let's nominate first. And then we vote we choose from the list. Mm-hmm. Well I'll nominate the one I proposed, Saving Private Ryan, so history, war, drem drama. And I haven't seen it, but I would like to see it and I think American Beauty. If you if you think that our series okay, it's not about America, but uh still Apocalypse well, yeah. It's about countries. So, Agnes, Denis? So Denis, are you happy with our choices or would you like to add something? Mm-hmm. Okay. So what if we voted, say, like for first and second choice and then we count? You can give two points to one and one point to another one? Would you like this strange way to vote? Um okay so uh Oh yeah, um well it's uh well if I nominated two and I was the only one, I'll give two points to Saving Private Ryan and one to American Beauty. You don't want to finish, Denis. Then you'd better hurry. Okay. Okay. That makes the vote more complicated. Um okay, so I'll give um uh b um okay, two to The Sixth Sense and one to The Big Lebowski. I note that you didn't nominate a film, so you are sort of freer than us. Agnes? Okay, oh. American Beauty four, Big Lebowski three. So you have to redo the posters, uh? Mm. Mm-hmm. You mean the first poster, yeah. Maybe you can leave those. Oh leave Julianne Moore. Okay, I'm looking forward to seeing it, I haven't see it, so Um so we have to select the movie for May. So uh we'll try a movie from the two thousands. And we can meet at the beginning of May. So I think Monday is second? No, Monday is third already. Mm whatever. Okay. Yeah, how many people we got and uh Mm-hmm. Maybe some kind of movies that spans across periods. I think there is a Godard with a lot of um quotations from other movies or well let's see when we Let's cross the bridge when we get to it. Thanks, see you April ni twenty ninth, American Beauty.
Speaker D: Hello. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. I haven't see it. it's a One hundred thousand. One hundred and two. For for voted for it, yeah. More votes? Yeah, it's it seems to be quite popular. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.. Yeah. So my presentation is not that detailed, I just uh put there seven uh highly uh ranked movies, and we can just try to g uh go very quickly through all of them, just to re remind you them, and then we can perhaps consider another p uh potential candidates. Okay, so the movies that I have selected as as very good uh good ranked movies uh are uh uh are on the screen so uh Shaw The Shawshank Redemption, Schindler's List, Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, Silence of the Lambs and American Beauty. Uh so perhaps we can go to the to the f to the first movie. Uh The Shawshank Redempt uh Redemption um actually I didn't see that movie, so is there someone else who have seen this movie? Okay. mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, the plot outline says that the life of Andy uh Dufresne Duf okay, of Andy, changes when he uh he's uh convicted and jailed for the murder of his wife, and the user comment says it's simply amazing, the best uh film of the nineties. So that's uh what it says, okay, we can't tell much more, because basically none of us have seen it. Mm-hmm, yeah. So the second one is a Schindler's list, it's more serious movie, it's from the St uh Steven Spielberg and it's about the Second War uh Sec Second World War. Uh the plot outline is that the Oskar Schindler uh uses Jews to uh start a factory in Poland during the war, and he witnesses the uh horrors uh endured by the Jews and starts to save them. User comment says, a film for all to see and learn, and I think it's really something what is very serious uh theme and uh yeah. So that's a Schindler's List, um we can perhaps do you have some comments? I I have seen it. I think it's really good movie, it's uh it's quite long actually, I can't uh here I didn't put the the minutes, but I think it's it's at least about three hours. Yeah. No, I don't know, I don't know, unfortunately. But I would expect it. I would expect it. Okay, so if you can go to the It's a true story, yeah. It's it's yeah, I would say that the user comment says everything, a film to see and to learn. And to remember as well, yeah. Okay, th so the third one is The Usual Suspects. So I think I I wouldn't uh I don't want to comment it again, so we can just skip that, because it was this this is the one already commented by Agnes. So let's go to the to the other one. Pulp Fiction. I would say that's that's like a classical movies of of nineties, uh it's uh directed by Quentin Tarantino, it's a it's a crime and drama, it's a a there i there are several s several stories that are just mixed up during the during the movie, and uh yeah, it's a real classical movie, I would say almost nowadays. So I've seen it. So all of us. Sure, sure, you can see it several times, because I mean the first time you cannot catch all the details, and then i when you see it second times and third times it's It's big comeback, yeah, big comeback of John Travolta, yes. I would say good comeback. Yes. Who is there? Huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Bruce Willis is there as a boxer, yeah. Um Yes. Okay, so that's Pulp Fiction, definitely should be considered uh. Mm-hmm. Wow, that's interesting. How. That may be. Yeah, because yeah because I have I have uh I have th this review on on Wednesday. Okay. It's Goodfellas, I haven't see that movie. The plot outline says that the Henry Hill and the his friends uh work their way uh their way up through the mob uh hierarchy, and uh the user comment says, it's a simply a masterpiece, so and if you go to the to the to the votes, there is quite a lot of people who has vote for the Goodfellas, sixty six thousand. Okay, it's It's modern day average, so it's perhaps not a bad movie. I dunno, I haven't see that. You have seen it? Yeah? Mm-hmm. uh-huh. And how i was it called, Mafia? Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm. So it talks about the nineteen twen twenties or something like o of twenties? Mm-hmm. Okay, so. Mob is mafia, mm-hmm. Okay. Silence of the Lambs, that's a godfather of all thrillers, I would say. Fully in line with the user comments. Uh basically it's a it's a thriller, horror and crime all together. The plot outline says that the uh Clarice Starling, the young F_B_I_ agent is assigned to help a f to help find a mi uh missing woman and save her from the ps psychopathic killer with the help of another killer. This another killer is actually in a jail and it's uh Anthony Hopkins, and he really plays it a very good, I would say. I'm not sure whether he received some a awards for that, but it's really it's Yes, very good performance, very good performance. Yeah, and we can see her actually on the picture on the on the projector.. Um uh ninety one uh ninety one uh. So nowadays she's already fourteen years older. Yeah. And I saw this movie when I was like uh twelve or thirteen and it was really really uh bad experience. So I can't remember all the details of that movie, but I would like to see it again. I recently I saw the the uh Hannibal, that the seco the sec uh it was a third third part actually, it was called Hannibal I guess. It was second one, yeah. So that's why It was really disgusting, yeah. Yeah. And the last choice that um I think it's it's not a bad movie, it's uh American Beauty. Uh it's basically about the about the people in America, each of them is uh I would say psychotic in his uh his own way, but uh normally they appear to be uh s normal people, as as we can see them ev every day. Uh so and it's really it's uh the user comments say it's a deep, wonderful, penetrating uh film, extraordinary uh irony uh in a psychological drama about American life, and I can fully agree with this user comment. Uh He's simulati I I I've seen this movie, but I Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. But then he fell in love with the the with the with the friend of uh his daughter, if I remember well. That's really Maybe. Yeah, yeah, that's true, yeah. Uh-huh. And I think that's the last If would like to go for something what is really serious I would definitely uh go for Schindler's List, and if not uh then Hmm. I would like to see this uh Shawshank Redemption, because it receive i yeah, it it none of us seen this movie unfortunately, but uh as you can see from the from your from your table, there is a plenty of votes. It's actually I think it's a movie with highest number of the votes, yeah, it is. Morgan Freeman, yeah. Darabont. Me neither, me neither. Yeah, but really I would like to highlight that it's a it's a movie with highest number of the votes and the highest ranking at the same time. So. And actually I don't think it's it's it's that popular in Europe at least, because I really you see, none of us have seen it, so. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But if I read your first point in the in this uh trivias, I am just surprised because it says that all the principle actors uh underwent several days of uh cruel army training except for the Man Matt Damon, and the reason was that they wan uh that the that the director wanted that uh the other actors would resent him. Why this was uh wanted actually? Yeah. And they didn't like it, they didn't like the mission? Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Yeah, and it okay. Yes. Most of them. So there is actually several people dying because of one single single soldier, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. I have no comments, no no, it's Yeah, but I really appreciate your table, because I found this table really useful. It's a very nice summary. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So doing nothing, just uh take it easy in the life, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And the one on the left is his friend? Aha, yeah. But this movie is is supposed to happen in uh what time, I mean it's uh Which ca From the nineties? And he's still uh still uh prepared from or or still as he he would come from the Vietnam. Okay. There i Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And this one is supposed to be the second Lebowski? Or who Okay, okay. But actually I'm I'm little bit missing th some information about our movie club, I think uh there should be some more information. Yeah I like this, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So perhaps we can somehow combine them. I think there is too many colours, too many colours. Nowadays, you know, if you see some advertisements on the s yeah, but nowadays if you see some advertisement on the on the street, this is typical typical uh poster I wouldn't wouldn't look at. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Exactly. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. How is it actually r ranked, because I cannot see it here in your table. I somehow can't find it. Ah, forty eight. Yeah, fifty thousand, mm-mm. Voted, yeah. Mm-hmm. Let's nominate, okay. So I will take basically two extremes, I will take Schindler's List and I will take uh The Big Lebowski. One of the one of them is really just funny and from the nineties, uh I mean the story is from the nineties, while the second one is about the Second War and is uh serious. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, that's Yeah, but then each of us will will uh but then each of us will vote for uh our nominees, so I would propose to to to vote for s sun uh to to give the points to the to the movies that were not nominated by you. So then it's it's more complicated but yeah, okay, let's Mm-hmm, okay. Sixth Sense. 'Kay. Seconds. okay, and I wi I will give one to The Big Lebowski and two to The uh uh Shawshank Redemption. So now try to sum it up. American Beauty. Uh three. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But I would say these images are very nice and they are really representative perhaps. Mm-hmm. I'm Yeah, sure, sorry. Sorry. I was sleepi sleeping for a while. Mm-hmm. It should be from this period, because nineties would be finished. Mm. Two thousand. Mm-hmm. Yeah.. Whatever. First Monday of May, yeah, so it's after the projection, and we will see what are the reactions of the people and so it makes sense that we are yes, yes, yes. And perhaps we will have some new members. Um American Beauty, finally. Okay.","When the meeting opens the project manager gives the agenda and says they need to choose a movie to project at the end of the month as well as decide on the content of advertising posters. ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""The Sixth Sense"". He lists some facts about each and explains what they are about. ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", and ""American Beauty"". The group discusses each of the movie nominations, and they eventuually choose ""American Beauty""."
24,"Speaker A: Okay. Uh first of all I'll start with the costs, because that's going to influence our design. If you Don't know if you al already had a look or not? Because we have a problem. If you look closely, you can see. Um I already took the liberty to make some suggestions... At the moment we have fifteen buttons, one L_C_D_ screen, one advanced chip-on-print. We use a uh sensor, that's for the speech. Uh we use kinetic energy. And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour. Okay. What's the first thing we should drop? The special colour of the buttons? Okay. Uh Should we switch to a hand dynamo? Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things. Batteries? Batteries.. Yeah. So You're going to redesign something. Okay, so we're at twenty five. Um Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved? Mm-hmm. Uh Yeah. Um Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine, so you can't directly access a channel, but instead use only the up and down arrows. That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros. Yeah? Uh then we have left Uh yeah. We do. They don't need special colours. Fine. That's more like it. You were saying something. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, some more menu options. Yeah. Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons. But um Now let's look. Mm-hmm. Uh Yeah, scroll-wheel, push-button uh Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah. It's uh One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button. So You could also drop j three more of these, without losing much functionality. You just drop the Okay and the Back. Oh, that's for the speech. Yeah. S s Drop speech recognition? Yeah that's possible. Buttons. That's not very easy to use. Yep. Okay. Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen, we need a lot of Yeah. We need a lot of extra buttons. Okay so we drop the speech. And drop it yeah? Okay. S Fo Four less Euros. So we still have three and a half Euro to lose. Yeah if you lose the the Back, the Okay button Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows, and the Menu button. Then you're Oh and the power button we have also. Yeah. So that's one Euro. Yeah. Yeah? And That would save zero point two Euros compared to No. Yeah. To This together is more expensive than Oof, it's almost the same as t keeping this. And we can drop these two. Volume. And the power button. That's the basic. Yep. Okay th that's Yeah that's one Euro more expensive. That's not an option. Menu, power. Four arrows? Power. Uh Yeah. Okay. So four arrows? Uh power I believe? Uh We have a Back and a Okay button. And the Menu. Yeah, and even if we drop three buttons from here, we still have to make some adjustments around here. So The L_C_D_? Yeah. Then I rather make it wood. Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people. No that maybe not. But maybe it's better than plastic anyway. Yeah? Yeah okay uh Yep. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay. Plastic. Uh that's easy because plastic is free. Yeah, okay. Uh if we dropped uh Yeah? You still need that. S No, I keep the re Yeah. Yeah. Because we already designed for it. So Yeah and something else. No y you would rec Then you have Then you still need two additional buttons I believe. For the volume. You can use those Yeah. Oh yeah and power. That's three buttons and this would cost Yeah. Three. Up, down, Okay. Yeah, okay. It would save enough Yeah you can choose this, drop these, then we have a half Euro left. So we can maybe still use power button. Yeah. Yeah. You see? Oh still Yeah? Oh then I miscalculated. Oh yeah. Shit. Drop the special colour. 'Kay. What else? Uncurved? Yeah. They made it very easy for us. Ah, I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say, this is better for the market so you sell more than Buttons. That's Oh yeah since we only have one button. I just m I don't I think Uh yeah it's I think it's grey, regular. Grey and rubber. Of plastic. Yeah. Yeah. No I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving, no. Yeah hand dynamo? Do you want an extra button? Yep? Instead of an additional power button? Yeah? It's for scroll Without Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down. So Yeah? So Woah we're within budget. It's a miracle. Yeah? Okay. Um, well. 'Kay, this was old. Yeah back to work. Uh Did I save it? Yeah. I I wanted to go, but I wasn't allowed. So Uh I just forgot to save this. Just a minute.. Yeah, this the last phase of course, so Hmm. Oh. Okay. Um Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation. But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense, because we had to drop it. Uh Yeah. Yeah it was more important, so I just pushed up the agenda. Uh, evaluation criteria. You have t produced something about that? Uh you put it in the. Yeah. F_ five. Alt up Freaky. Yeah. Uh, of course we dropped a little bit of those uh Mm-hmm. Two. Uh y we should fill this in now. Yeah okay. Uh Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three. But now, in original design I say two. Okay then I say three. Hey, you're marketing, eh. Hmm. M maybe underline. Red. Oh yeah very true. He types everything. Everything. You don't use anything else. Yeah. Yeah okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Nope. Uh check with the Excel sheet. Yeah integrate it. Yeah. Just go scrolling and it will activate. It shows the most used functions and they are relevant, but You say you double click on the No, not anymore. Because he's now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in. Like on the the mouse. Yeah. To get into menu. Yeah. Or hold it ten seconds. No no no. Uh it should be trendy. Yeah. Four. Yeah, im in the menu. Five. It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen. So Well it's different. Yeah. Yeah, it's still Yeah, I say two. Oh, that's the next. Two. Yeah definitely. You still have rubber d Or no. Yeah. Yeah. The one button we have. Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet. Yeah. Yeah or three. We have something. New. Yeah. You like both. Um oh yeah. I just couldn't Um, just one minute.. So. No not anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah well yeah. No Yeah okay. So Ooh. And Yeah? What? Yeah. Yeah. That Count them. Add them? Or Could somebody start calculator? Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. You have to 'Kay. So four and Nice work. O one. Plus five. Bo Uh two. Four. Start over? You can Oh yeah. Okay. Three, four, nine. Uh Eleven, fifteen. Seventeen. S Uh That was the last one. That was that. Yeah. So divided by nine. So Yeah. Divided by nine. So thr t two. So we're better than average. No. Things, yeah. Okay. It's still yeah. Has some shortcomings. Okay so Um this we had, this we had. We have to do a product evaluation. Uh prototype presentation we dropped. So Uh the finance we looked. We have redesigned. Uh not on that, but So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen. Yeah uh The the button has a special colour, the frame has a special colour. It's plastic. And single curved. Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED. Otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well. Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far. And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet. So I Yeah I'm I'm somewhere, but maybe you can help me. Uh I was here. So Ah That's enough to get started with, so Uh, I just took one for every step and then a conclusion. Yeah. Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance. Yeah. Mm-hmm. .... I don't think so, if you see the options. But Yeah. You can't even draw anymore. Even children can draw. Can you just push pen and then keep on Hmm. Yeah. Yeah just on the the m um the L_C_D_ display. This is your Real Remote. Yeah. Yeah. You can just reuse that, because the name is the same. Initials. Mm. Luckily. Yeah, it's uh Yeah. Okay. And copy this. Just a minute. It's It's somewhere I d It isn't inside. Yeah, and don't know how it's or eject it. From up there? No. Yeah it's somewhere in here. Save copy. Yeah.. Yes.. Well Um now you probably have to recalibrate. Oh, five minutes to the end of the meeting. And the recalibration is done using this icon here. Yeah well I just Okay. You go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Then I have to uh uh write this, and I don't know if you have to present, because I didn't receive any information about that so far. Maybe we get a a final mail. Yeah. Yeah, I have still ten minutes to finish the report. Yeah. And you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or oh no, they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate. You can just if you ma finish my presentation please. Uh over there. The presentation is still open. So if you finish that then you'll see uh Yeah next. Oh yeah, we have to do the project uh evaluation. Just uh do that quickly. Uh Uh well basically what that says, we discuss it and um So how were did the project process uh go? Did you, were you all pleased with the process as it was? Or are there uh Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed, and and so forth. Yeah. Mm-hmm.. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay and was that due to my leadership? Yeah? That okay? Okay. Um was there uh enough room for creativity? So and the uh about the board digital pen? Uh was that helpful or Ooh. Yeah it works. Mm-hmm. Use the pen. Yeah yeah. Blink. Oh. Okay, are are there any new ideas about this? All I think I didn't really receive, yeah. Uh uh w uh S sorry uh Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh. Uh we should uh enter our questionnaire. Ah. Woah. Okay. Uh okay. That's the management. Hope so. Um
Speaker B: Did you do your questionnaire already? Uh It wants Yeah but everything is. Just a normal battery then, yeah. Oh my goodness. Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then. I mean we have to drop on everything. Yeah. How about Sorry. That's what I was thinking. A a And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well. That was exactly my point. Like let's drop all the buttons, and just make one I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway. So we'll just have to use it for everything. And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen, and select a channel, click Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then. Yeah. Kind of. I was Because Yeah. If you if you go to If you go to our uh view, like you if you are in the sound system there, uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance, this is just uh an example, y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example. But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound, right? So you wanna click on it, activate it, whe and when you move it, hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound. So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah it's r Yeah. No. No but Yeah it's it's expensive, but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition. 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons. I No. Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works. We uh we we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system, so we can might as well s drop that. We need to lose some buttons. Which That's even Yeah, if you if you go to eight I don't know how to Yeah, we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display. Yeah. True. Oh. Hmm. Yeah uh You uh uh Yeah. So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker, and Which can use a regular chip, wh which is six Euros in total. That doesn't matter. Well yeah. Exactly. Yeah but the uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already. And then if w Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want, huh? And uh Yeah d at l Yeah. At least one for power. Oh. Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now. Yeah endlessly. I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on. You can go into you in you main menu, you can choose uh flip channel, uh you can choose sound options, any options. Yeah. Maybe we should. 'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen. I guess we have to. We'll we'll be on Yeah it says right here. Yeah. But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though. Damn. Yeah and then Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Well, you only have to power it up when you wanna use it. I don't know.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the most import We only have Yeah but Well we come back to the drawing board then, huh? It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing. Oh yeah? okay. Drop everything. Yeah. We went straight into finance? For Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I think it does. Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_, right? Yeah. Well, we have extended menus, on the on the L_C_D_ screen. So I No. Yeah. Yeah alright. Yeah yeah. Definitely one. It has to be. You're not gonna find them. Yeah the next Not so much so. Yeah. Yeah it's uh it's integrated. E exactly just like a m mobile.. Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something, if When it's on, yeah, it's turned on, It automatically has the the programme and the volume function, but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some Of you Or you double click it. No because it has four arrows, right? Oh yeah. Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick. Say. Yeah that is a bummer. We'll make it a Morse code. Yeah. Yeah I would go for five or six, yeah. Okay five. Let's not diss our remote. Yep. Just one button. But Uh yep. We still have the fruit and vegetable print. Fr Oh I mean the Oh never mind. I'm a bit lost.. It's way more practical, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we still uh we still have the primary colours. But only on the on the outside, not on the button. Yeah? Okay. Yeah. Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve. And and colour. Yeah. S Yeah. Uh Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one. Because it's basically an old one, uh with little curve on the side, and in a different colour. Still, it's still hard. I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape, that would give it something young and fresh. Of course. Yeah but it be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen, we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well. But Hell yeah. If we have only one button. And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_, doesn't it? So No. The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers. 'Cause it has only one button. Yeah exactly. I would say six. It's really not easy to use. 'Cause you're putting everything Most votes count. Um Definitely in casing, 'cause we have a hard plastic Yeah. Yeah because the the batteries, those thingies last forever. And the the casing, hard plastic also lasts forever. So I would go for one. Okay yeah. Oh. No m I would g I would go for four. Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. That's it. Ah we can do the math. Uh Yeah. Did you make this questionnaire or what? Oh. I wouldn't be able to do it that fast. F Pretty difficult. Just type in the digits. They're all one digit numbers right? And then you can count them together. Eleven. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Oh what? How hard is this? Never mind. Twenty four. Twenty eight. Twenty eight. Yeah the lower the The lower the score the better, right? Yeah but But I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings? I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative. So if you give a true to a positive, it actually means that the low the lower the better. But if you give true to a negative question No? Durable, that's good. Easy to use. Yeah.. Also good. Yeah okay. I guess you did do it. Oh yeah yeah. No Okay. Okay. Yeah true. Yeah definitely definitely. Because now it's just an average It's remote. Yeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen. But uh it looks and stuff, it still uh it's not, it's not really eye-catching, except for the colour. Yeah. Product evaluation. Shall we try? Black. Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours? But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue? One scroll button and For what? Should give it some time? Yay. Have to take this away also. And this um Oh yeah, of course. Um pen yeah? Format. Current colour red. Oh Yeah we did our special colour for the Line widths, now that's a ten. It's gonna be one str scroll. Horizontal's easier too, 'cause you can Is it more natural than this? So let's say Whoops. 'Kay. Basically. It's really ugly. Oh What do you mean? Like a other colour than this one? Yeah can we do it uh uh can we do a print? I think we have to choose, yeah? Okay special colour. We do have special colour. Does it mean uh that Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty? Purdy. Purple? Yeah yeah. Oh no my remote has acne. No. That's why we have that button. It's so cute. Doh. Is that that? How the We did we do that? We can try. That doesn't respond also to the undo. It looks like it's No, Where do you want some more dots? Okay, it's not the prettiest, I know. It's not so random huh? Yeah okay. We can make a l a logo. Like uh put it like the shape. Something like that. I mean it's not too uh That's not their logo, is it? Yeah. It's a How Shall we do the logo in black or not? Are you dissing my drawing? This one? It looks like a ribbon. So who wants to draw? This is actually quite fun. Do we need to do anything? I hear you people are typing. Oh, okay. It's almost four. At four, yeah,? This is really bizarre. It looks like there's a It looks like a butterfly. No, but it i It's not a bu a beamer. B It's a normal T_V_ screen, kind of thing. Oh. Yeah there is some kind of projection I think. With a with a mirror, huh? Or something. Yeah. So are we gonna change anything to this? I mean is it gonna This is gonna be flat. Yeah exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And this is also gonna be Nope. But sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work. Maybe No it's I think you only need two points. Or not. No, you sh Slanted yeah. Yeah. Well maybe. Yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing. Yeah. Yeah it's only a bit like to that side, but that is that one by the way. 'Cause this one makes the angle either like this. So i if I change this, it will go there, if I change that, will go there. Mm-hmm. I will take this away 'cause it looks messy. Maybe we will. What's this anyway? It looks like candle wax. Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us? Or Yeah well at first I was really stressed. Because it went a bit fast. But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on, the second time I think I did a bit better. And the third time yeah, I mean Yeah, yeah yeah yeah. Yeah we Mm-hmm. Yeah. Definitely. Well you did become more assertive the the second time round, so that Yeah. You were more in charge kind of thing. I guess so. I mean I We were pretty democratic. Yeah. Maybe Yeah. It's uh it's The the pen is more intuitive, 'cause we're all used to writing with pen. And uh as I said, uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works, so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation. But once I get to know the program probably, I mean, it looks better, you know. Or uh something like that. You can give it a kind of a home style, like we have i the the logo and everything. And I don't know. Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well. You know, you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there, or whatever. Alright. Alright. Well, s see you in a second huh?. Yeah we have to pull it this way, huh? Wait.
Speaker C: . Oh,. No. Oh. No. Yeah but young people like that. So just do normal battery. Yeah. It has to be twelve and a half. Or not? Uh, yeah. But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved, but from the side it's it's flat, and the screen screen is just Well you just have to hold it like this then. So Alright. Let's do it then. Yeah. we F_ eight. Yeah. The joystick. Integrated scroll-wheel push-button, yeah. Yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button. So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it, adjust it, click again and then you're out of it. But you still But you then still need to have Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels. But you still um You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back. Yeah. Well not all. Not s not sound I guess. Mm. Yeah. Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker? Speech recognition. Right. Buttons. No, it can be disturbed by by noise and stuff like that. Let let let me see what's more what's more popular. I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition. I have to look on that. Let me see. Uh well no I was wrong. There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen. But if it But it it it's a it's a both a hypers No, but Well we Yeah we keep the screen. I mean it's it's about the same. Eight one to ninety one percent, uh sixty six to seventy six. Yeah. Let's drop the speech. Sixteen Euros. But y y Yeah. Yeah. And then and then use um The the Okay. And the menu button does also does the okay function then. And then when you in the menu S so so you activate the menu. Yeah yeah. Yeah.. Well okay. For example if you have f f four buttons, channel up and down, uh volume left right Okay, I've I think we have to keep that. And then and the power button. So that's five. That's basic. That that's what you need anyway. And then for the menu, um you can have a button that activates menu. Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button. And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel, the the the menu gets activated, and then you can scroll, choose an option, click on it, it goes into an feature. Click on it again, selects features, scroll, adjust it. Click again, it's okay. Then you only need one button to move back. Or or under each option, you set a you set an a screen thing what says back, and you select that one, click again, and you go one step back. And in that menu, scroll, click, one step back. So that then you need five buttons, and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button. But we can't drop three buttons. But I see that's Yeah. So that's not a good idea. Because which buttons do we have now? Those five which I mentioned, and then menu, and then Yeah. F of the four things? Yeah, th power. Which more? Yeah. Power. Th Yeah that's five. Yeah, okay that's seven, and one to activate the menu, yeah. So okay that's eight. Well we can't reduce that. We we keep the display. Oh, well okay. Yeah. Yeah well we need the advanced Instead of r Yeah but but that's not our market. Ah no, hard plastic. Yeah, plastic with special colour. No but I I Because we have to use the special colour anyway. You forgot that. So let's go for the plastic. And since it's not kinetic, it doesn't have to flip around that much? We still have problem of two Euros. Yeah we can't drop them. Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display? Oh. I rather keep I rather keep the display. So the only option is an hand dynamo. Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro, right. And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use. I mean it's not that important, easy to use, but Yeah. You you press it for like three seconds. Then then then you should do everything in the menu. On the screen. Yeah. Yeah, but we'd Alright. It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half. So let's see, we we drop the price by one and a half. But we still have thirteen left. Thirteen. So still half. There goes the special co Well That would make it less appealing. So that's no option. We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display? Well yeah. yeah. We made it hard for ourselves with the display, but it's a cool feature. Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour? S yeah. Alright. Yeah. So I rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour. You can still play with it then I guess. I don't know. Yeah, but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working. So I guess that isn't an option. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah true. Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then. Or or do we Or do we do uncurved and flat? Instead of Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour. And a screen. Yeah. S what what is special f Oh yeah, special form. Maybe that's nicer. But we don't have any buttons. So do d Uh make it a special colour then. Yeah ma make it a special colour then. Okay. Make it a special colour and then it look fancy. So Yeah. Let's let's save it. Yeah. Let's do it like this, I mean, because it does not lose our identity of the product as we Yeah all your designs are uh pretty much Yeah but that but that's the fun part of it. Alright. Yeah what's the next uh phase? Uh the agenda. By your humble P_M_. Oh f Frustrated. Alright. Yeah. Drop, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that that's Yeah. I uh I sure did. And it combines with product evaluation. Uh so We all have to keep in mind what has changed now. So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements. Alright. Let's make it big. Um Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale, as following. Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah. True or false, and then on a scale of seven points, a scale, as we all know it. Um Well the criteria are based on the user requirements, uh the trends from the marketing research, and the marketing strategy of the company itself. Um well they are in a Word document, which I will open now. Yeah. I don't know it's open yet. No. And we all have to uh agree on a certain level. What's this? Oh. I don't know. Um Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user. So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions. How do you think about that? Yeah the us u It it it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions, in this question. So do you think Yeah. You can you can ma Yeah, you can make a lot of extended menus. That's true. I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited, to to build in menus in the screen. So on a scale from one to seven, what do you think? Huh? Two or three? Something like that? Well we have to choose one. So uh what do you say? I agree on two. Yeah. I uh I say two, personally. But Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now. Yeah? You say three, and you you said al also three? Three? Okay well I say still two, but it has to be three then. Yeah I know. So it's made bold. But it's nah, it's not very clear on the sc Maybe other colour, yeah. That's better. Uh Yeah. Alright. Oh, it doesn't have to be bold anymore. Alright. Yeah. Um well the remote control has Wha The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions. For example audio settings and screen settings. Yeah. Well, yeah. So it it's a very true point. I mean it hides all those function. But, I mean uh they're hidden in the screen. If you don't want to use them, you don't s you s just scroll over them. And you place them F I don't know where. So that's very true, I guess, for our case. Uh the second point. It shows the relevant and most used functions. Power button. Do we ha still have a power button? Well yeah the button's integrated, huh? Yeah we dropped it. You j you just push it in for Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something, and then Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Um it shows the relevant and most used functions. Yeah uh on the other uh on one side I would say yes, and the other side I would say no. So it's I don't know. Yeah. With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel. And then Hmm? Yeah. Yeah. But but how do you change from volume to channel? No. No we have n we have no buttons left. So the joystick was not an option. So so you hav So you you have to double-click, I mean, for, I mean, uh volume, and three double click for the menu, or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. But but ease of use was not very important, may I remind you. So that's Yeah but that that's not a question. Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions. Well I think it's pretty much in the middle. You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen, in the menu. So So maybe it's more like a f a five. Or Yeah. Five or six? Five? Alright. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition. Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition. But it has at least one innovation. I say two then. Yeah but that that's not that's not this question. Uh thi uh that's the other question. This one. Two yeah. I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech What? Oh not the bold one. Right. Okay, it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints, primary colours and sponge-like material. It should have been two questions. I realise now, because sponge-like material is dropped. But the look and feel Yeah. The button has also colour. Yeah. Yeah. The one. Mm mm. Yeah we have single curve now, and no and no material. So maybe in the middle or something. Yeah, I mean it's worth the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But then we would have to drop the screen. Oh red. Yeah. Yeah. I like bold. Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo. Yeah. You just have to draw it. Yeah. But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo. I mean, if there's only one thing. Yeah. So I will say that is very true. Yeah. The remote control is easy to use. Well I would say Skill, uh I would say six, or something. I don't think it's easy to use, or not so. Yeah. Yeah. It it it has a nice screen. But Yeah. Yeah. Well I I would say a five or a six. What do you say? Easy to use? Five or a six? So a six, more. Yeah, uh I would go for the six too. So Um well, another question, uh the remote control is durable. I don't know if that's the correct word. But uh In use, both battery as casing? Yeah? True, true. And the casing is plastic,? Yeah. If you don't drop it too much, it's uh should last pretty long. Yeah? But uh I think rubber compared is better. So I think a two is more appropriate than Yeah. Logo. Okay I will go go for two. Uh the last one? The remote control's a good example for company's motto, we put the fashion in electronics. uh turn around. Yeah. But um Yeah? It's not Yeah, true. So a four. It's it g it g goes, it's not the best we could do, I guess. But it all has to do with the budget, because it's it's not the bad idea we had, so Alright, yeah. Right. So if I understood it right, we have to count these numbers. Uh Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh Oh Alright. Word document, the Yeah we have to count them. Uh Yeah just add them and then uh divide them. Yeah. Mm. I all made it po I I all made it I all made it possible uh for a positive questions, so we can count it. I mean if you have reversed question, you have to reverse the scale, uh Yes. Yeah. Thanks. Oh Easy. Question number four, yeah? Yeah. How hard is it? Yeah just use Oh there tho uh there's no n There's no num pads. It's a it's a bit uh Yeah. I think you can just count them by a Um let's move over. Three, plus one, four. Nine. Uh, yeah. Are you here? Eleven. Fifteen. Sixteen, yeah. No sixteen. Uh sixteen plus six. Twenty two. Twenty two, yeah? Tw Twenty Twenty eight. Twen Uh okay. By nine. That's uh three uh Or le less than a three. Yeah. Twenty eight di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one. Yeah. Yeah, but there are no negative questions I guess. Good example. Durable use. Easy to use. This is good. Fancy look and feel, that's good. Technology innovation was good, because of a marketing uh requirement. Re relevant most used function. And hides these functions. That was also a good thing. And then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing. So it were all positive questions, by uh by purpose. So Yes, so the It tells us something, yes. Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things, I guess. Yeah. Nah it it's it's better than average, but Yeah. So th Yeah. No. The colour and the screen. Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this With some casing around it, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Do we have to do other things? Or just redesign? Alright. Yeah. So you made a start, right? Yeah. Alright. The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables, like primary colours, spongy shape. The playfulness, we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour Okay. That's conceptual, yes. Mm. How many pages? Alright. Y you have you have done the first two. Okay, and and the look and feel is Yeah. The items we had to drop. Where did we start with price? Twenty six and a half. Or not? Or twenty six? Something like that. This? Speckles? Uh Yeah. Yeah. Some some big dots. Yeah. .... We have the original balance sheet, or Yeah. Woah. Just cut. Control Z_. Yeah. Yeah. Just dual screen. Very nice. Yeah. Y y you you you push the button or something. Or Lot of options. Yeah, the R_ and another R_. It's called the Real Remote, right? Maybe maybe it c it can say that. The Real Remote. Yeah. Welcome. Yeah. Yeah. You can copy and paste the picture if you want. Yeah. What is that? Look more Looks more like a campfire. Yeah. Yeah. Type in your report. I don't see any new messages. So Hmm? Luckily, yeah. What time do we have to deliver the report? Four o'clock or Or before that? Just compare uh No it's on the on the beamer I guess. Yeah. Strange. This something what's projection from behind, I guess. Yeah it it's a beamer, but then with a within a mirror, yeah. So it looks like a big screen, but in fact it isn't. Well it's it's single single curved. Th this is flat. Yeah. But it's it's better to have in the front, this kind of shape, because it looks nice. I mean you see more of this than of that. Yeah, more like that. It's not very uh ideal. Do like this. Yeah. What's this? Ooh. But I don't see a detector over there. I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on, and then draw right lines or something. Yeah. Or just messed it up. Yeah. Yeah but it wasn't good. Yeah it it has to touch the corners, I guess. But th this one wasn't good, because if I was drawing here, I drew a line and then it came over here. Oh. Ooh. Yeah yeah, it's it's okay. It's working again. It's better than before. Yeah. Yeah that's improved uh pretty much. Yeah. Yeah but it's better, it's better Mm. No. It's better than it was I guess. Silly. Yeah. Works pretty well. Five minutes before the meeting's over. And then? We have to present Alright. So it after the after after these five minutes, you have to Alright. After after that five minutes, you have ten minutes to finish it, or Alright. And we uh Right. Chill. Huh. Uh Yeah? Next slide. Yeah? How do you do it? Alright. Yeah. Yeah. And we move more to to working together as team, because at first you you make your individual contribution, and then come here, and you have no idea what the others have to make. And then finally you have some idea, okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that, and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own. So The process, I mean, the interaction between us became better and better I guess. Yeah, especially if f f if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Li Limiteded afterwards, but If if you don't take that into account, there's plenty of room for creativ creativity. Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people, by means of uh the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that. Mm uh I think in in essence the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard. Because it it it just works better. I mean uh uh I've made yeah, uh I've made several notes just to test it, and and just put the pen in into it, and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly. So it it's better a better device than uh than the screen. But the screen is useful, in essence, but it doesn't work that well. Yeah. Yep. Warning. Finish meeting now. Well, it It's use especially useful, I guess, to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff. And and the screen and stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience, and then to Yeah. These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things. So Yes. Check your email. You also. Right. Yes boss. Well see you soon. Yeah.
Speaker D: Oh no. No n I I already did it. It's not much. It's just one question. Yeah. No that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look. So Yeah, b but I think the battery option. Oh. Oh no. Yeah. But we don't have any basic options any more. Yeah we c could We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing. Everything you can do with with the menu. So With the display. Yeah. So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button. And then just drop all the other buttons. But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons. Yeah. So we have to to make it s uh more uh It has to be Could drop the speech recognition. We we d Yeah. Yeah. We lose our whole concept. Uh so No we just We keep the L_C_D_. Yeah. If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons, we can drop all the the push-buttons. With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing. With the other, we can do the the channel, the volume, et cetera. No it's three Euros. No? Um No it's it's n Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. It's the Let's make the Let's make the case plastic. Yeah. But Plastic with a with a special colour. A woo wood uh wood uh wood colour. That's an option. Yeah. So we do one one s Yeah. Hmm. No the buttons, those are really needed. Yeah th th it's it's uh An advanced chip-on-print. Oh that But the But the integrated uh button? How many func functions can it uh have? Okay. Oh no. No no, it has to be um curved. Okay. Okay. Wh what we could do is um drop the the special colour, and uh do the special colour for the buttons. Yeah. Just something else than than black or white I think. Yeah. The display The But if you have to power the for ten minutes, then the Yeah. No no it has to be curved. Yeah. Just put a special special colour of the buttons, or something. Yeah or spe special form? Yeah. Yeah. But it's it's for the integrated button, I think also. Or Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yep. Oh just oh ma make it two special colours, but we only have one button. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yep. Two or three. Two or three. Yeah. Yeah. Or give it a colour. Yeah true one. Yeah. It hides uh basic functions. Yeah true. I think we are It's in Oh yeah it was integrateds. Yeah. Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button? No, you have to scroll through the menu, before Yeah. So it's it's not No. Yeah. Oh no. Seven. Yeah. Five. Five. Yep. Yeah. I think a two. No. Yep. No you got a plastic. Yeah. Yeah. You only have one Yeah. Four. Yeah. Red. Mm yeah yeah. It's the white part uh Yeah. We have a we have a Mm-hmm. Ah i And that you only have to control one button. It gives visual feedback. So I think a five. Five. Okay. Yeah. Yeah that looks uh great. Yeah. Nah Yep. Yeah. S Yep. Wow. No we put the electronics into the fashion. Yeah, four is okay. Okay. Three plus? Plus one. Plus five? Oh. Wait a second. Oh. It's it's gone wrong. Okay. It's your turn. No it's if you press twice on the plus button, then you get s s No. That's why it's uh Just count it to Yeah. Sixteen. Twenty two. Twenty four. Twenty six. Oh, sorry.. Oh my. Okay. Twenty eight. Hmm. Some questions are Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh great. Okay it's your turn now. Yeah. Yeah we we can just uh use this one. And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh he only needs one button. Yeah. Or we have to delete this one or Oh oh no. Okay. So that's Okay, but how do we make the the scroll uh button? It's just one yeah. Uh that's the infrared uh thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, uh it's just a scroll Yeah, is it's horizontal or vertical? I think Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yes. It doesn't look like uh Uh it it's it's not Yeah. It's not very fashionable anymore. But uh it's okay. Yeah. Maybe m make it bigger? Or Yeah. That looks little bit more uh Maybe that's a s a special colour for it. So we can make it uh special? Or or speckles in it? I dunno. Uh I'm not sure. Yeah red is already a special colour, I think. So It's not very special, but uh Yeah. Just uh put the purple uh purple on it. That's trendy. Woah. Oh yeah. Hmm. Oh what?? Oh no. No no. Yeah. Oh it's it's just one computer? Or No. But can we delete it, just with delete? Or Crashed. Oh, no. Okay. Yeah, over here. Hmm? What's this? Oh yeah. Oh that's the select button. It's uh No, it looks It's okay. Specially the the R_. D designed by Okay. No. Do they have a lo Oh, the here. This i this is the logo. Two R_s and a one. Yeah. Okay. Are we uh ready? Uh Or Is this uh the last assignment? Or Final Um bug. Bug. No it's in inside the No it Oh. Hey, you've got it uh read only. So you have to uh. It's too uh It is It's now single curved. So It's flat. Oh no. Okay. It doesn't matter. It's it's That's the detector uh for the Okay. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe that's why it's it's not working, because it's more Yeah. Oh. Oh yeah. Yeah. You've to make it s uh ninety degrees. You have Oh we're always long. Yeah, can we t can we get to that i Oh it's not working anymore. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah, it's it's working, it's working. Yeah. We're improving uh Yeah. Yeah. No it So cake. No. No. Yeah. Yeah. Especially after the first meeting. And Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah but only the the financial parts uh Yeah. Yeah. Finish meeting. I think the PowerPoint is is too limited. You can't uh draw easy in in PowerPoint. It has to be uh yeah. The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint, so that you can just easily Yeah. Yeah just for text, for text it's uh it's okay. But 'Kay. Okay. Oh. Okay.","Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs , because that's going to influence our design . Because we have a problem . It has to be twelve and a half . You're going to redesign something . Okay , so we're at twenty five . Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . I mean we have to drop on everything . Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . But we don't have any basic options any more . They don't need special colours . I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah . we need one integrated button for everything then . But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons . Could drop the speech recognition . There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Let's drop the speech . if you lose the the Back , the Okay button Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button . With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . So let's go for the plastic . So the only option is an hand dynamo . drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons . Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then . Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . Woah we're within budget . oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it . We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . I think it does . Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . It shows the relevant and most used functions . It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , Okay five . Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . Yeah , I say two . Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button . Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve . It should have been two questions . I realise now , because sponge-like material is dropped . . So maybe in the middle or something . Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo . But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , if there's only one thing . And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , The remote control is easy to use . Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so . The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button . Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six . It's really not easy to use . uh the remote control is durable . Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever . Yeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long . But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate Okay I will go go for two . The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so Yeah , four is okay . So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers . Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . And then you can count them together . That's uh three uh Or le less than a three . makes three point one one one one one one one . So we're better than average . I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings ? I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess . So it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . So Yeah true . Yes , so the It tells us something , yes . it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour . Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? Yeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour . Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED . Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet . but maybe you can help me . Okay , but how do we make the the scroll uh button ? The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . Yeah , is it's horizontal or vertical ? Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance . It's not very fashionable anymore . But uh it's okay . Maybe that's a s a special colour for it . So we can make it uh special ? uh can we do a print ? I'm not sure . Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ? We have the original balance sheet , or Okay , it's not the prettiest , I know . Maybe maybe it c it can say that . The Real Remote . Shall we do the logo in black or not ? Is this uh the last assignment ? Or Well it's it's single single curved . But it's it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice . and I don't know if you have to present , because I didn't receive any information about that so far . Yeah , I have still ten minutes to finish the report . You can just if you ma finish my presentation please . Oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation . So how were did the project process uh go ? Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast . But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better . because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So The process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess . Yeah . Especially after the first meeting . Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that Um was there uh enough room for creativity ? but only the the financial parts uh Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that . So and the uh about the board digital pen ? the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because it it it just works better . But the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well . And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . Finish meeting . Okay , are are there any new ideas about this ? It's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . I think the PowerPoint is is too limited . Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . Yeah . But it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience , and then to Uh we should uh enter our questionnaire . Yes . Check your email ."
73,"Speaker A: Yep. Okay. Oh. Well we will try. Where it going? Hmm. Uh Mm. So Now save? Now uh blank? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now. Okay. Wow. Oh. Nice. Uh at home we have a T_V_, a video uh recorder, a D_V_D_ player, and a satellite receiver. We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that. That's not really ea easy. So it would be nice if we have one for all. And we also had a remote control for our radio set. But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what. And it was uh uh v not easy to use. So we n barely used it. Yeah. Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice. Or you won't sell it. And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have. And it should work with as many uh as possible of them. Yes. Okay.
Speaker B: Hmm. That's uh strange. Yeah. Okay. Let's try this. Uh Um. Mm-hmm. Mm. Uh No, no. Yeah. Okay. Uh blank. No. Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set. And that it controls the channels and the the volume. And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote. So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it. And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working. And uh yeah. Uh Yeah, but No no no. But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah well that's that are good ideas. Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working. If you push a button. Um Yeah. And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material. So probably plastic or something. Uh Mm no. Yes.
Speaker C: Nice. An elephant. 'Kay... pop-ups. What is this, Pictionary. Uh a bird. Bird. Yeah. Whoo. Oh not. Oh. Okay. Okay. Yeah. No problem. Shit happens. A parrot. Ish. He did it before. Oh. Thank you. Uh I will start. Uh Big one, they are uh not easy to use. Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke. So that won't be uh our goal, I think. And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think. Not all the small buttons, you don't know Big buttons, positive. All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for. Thank you. Help also. Thank you. The weight. Not not too heavy. Not much buttons. Bust-free. That when you drop it, it won't break. Like uh some kind of rubber on it. Or hard uh hard plastic. Uh buttons not too small. Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen. Uh it between the couch and you can't find it. When you push a but a button on the T_V_, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep. And then you uh, hey there there's remote control. Next. I have one more idea. Just popped up. Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries. So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks. Okay. Thank you.
Speaker D: So welcome. The first kick-off meeting. What shall we do? First the opening, then the rest. What are we going to do. We m have to make a new remote control. It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly. So we will get back th on that. First we have to make a functional design. After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design. So we'll discuss that later. First we have a look at. So first to we have to make a small painting. What have do we have to do. First you can save the documents. We have to do that every time we make something. You can print it. No. And we have to use the pen and the eraser. So Now. We all have to use this one. You have to make your own favourite animal. So I'll make an example. First don't touch that things. You can use the pen. And then you can make um something. Um you can change some things. Um format, line, and change it. And you can change the colour. So that's it. So So and after it you have to save it. Now we can make a new one. You have to paint now. So you're next. What is going on? What are you What?. Um Is a It is a It is a A duck. Yes. Hmm. Blank, yes. Okay next one. Oh. Very good. Okay. Very good. So um you can always go back. So That's it. So that was two. Now next. The budget. The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros. And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it. So now we have to think about what we will make. First I wanna hear from you. Uh what are your experiences with remote controls. So F first. Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons? Positive. Okay. What are your experiences? Mm. So and do they always have that? It's easy to you. Okay. 'Kay. Okay so they have too much. So next. For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it. So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control? What what does it have to have? Not too heavy. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Like a phone. Okay. So, that's. Okay. Yes. Okay. This is It has to be compatible with other things. Okay. Yes? No battery use. So more ideas? No okay. It's only the first ideas. So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour. Uh Okay. Next meeting, half an hour. Um, what you have to do. Well look on your. And Next instructions you'll get in your email. So This is the first meeting. See you later in half an hour.","For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries."
132,"Speaker A: Or you get it. Okay. Mm. Yours is well Yeah but the the mic should not Yeah. Mm. Can't help you with that. Okay, it's y yeah. Right. Then press uh al This. You know? Oh oh. Right well Wow. Amazing. It's working. Yeah. Under documents in the shared folder. Okay. Yeah, I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share. And uh, yeah. Yes. Each of us is going. Okay, shall I start? So, i But it's Actually, I think I cannot go with uh Yeah. Okay. You're on the knife. Mael. Yeah, I think I will go without without it, right? Yeah. And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics, right? So Uh yeah. And i Th They like to sleep, that's why you said you they are like this. Yeah. She has the small legs. Yeah. Thank you, Matthew. Perfect. Oh a rat, okay. And you, A bird. Okay, in the water. Mm. Yeah. Put it colours. Maybe it would help us. With different pen widths. Ah it's a shark, yeah. Oh. You have some in in Australia, right? Yeah. I dunno. Oh well. Yeah. Perfect. So I dunno if we need to spend time on that, actually But uh Yeah, exactly, yeah. Wow. Yeah. Per remote control, yeah? Per project. So it's half of the selling price, if I am good in mathematics. Of course. Oh you're g very good in mathematics. Four million. Yeah. And uh just before starting the detailed discussion, maybe we You are the marketing guy? Or th So you are the marketing. And you are in the u use user interface uh design. So just yeah I wanted to to be sure. And I I'm the the industrial designer okay. Because I I don't know you very well, actually, but yeah. Okay. Mael. Happy to meet you. Okay. It's very uh Uh so yeah uh Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face. So mm So I Like what? Like internet on the on T_V_? Yeah. Actually, yeah w Of course, and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities, we need to know what are the user requirements. Um then if they need internet, then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_. But before Yeah, but w w we want to design a new one. Mm. Yeah. The Yeah, the main is browsing. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Perfect.
Speaker B: So we uh we will wait for Anna, a few minutes. I think it should work like this. So I will try to get my presentation running. Mm. It's no matter. No problem. Ah yes. I don't know. Just try. On this normal Good. Doesn't appear on the screen here. Oh. Okay. Thank you. Uh. Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your Somewhere. So, good morning, everyone. Um Welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project. I hope you all have been uh updated about it. Good. So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here. Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other. See what our roles are in this project. So, um We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh to communicate and to well, learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before. Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan. You all know I hope how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design. Uh then we will uh discuss uh, well, how it should be and uh wh what uh what our new product should look lite like. And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting. So. Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control. Um We When you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original. Be uh we want to be distinguished, mm? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think, well that's the product I I need. So it needs to be trendy. I mean trendy is what people want, so then I w they will buy our product. But then, uh, it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that. So, the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase. Um You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design. And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this, the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape. Alright, but first we will do some uh tool training. In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a a a a white-board. And um well it should work uh I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar. I didn't find out yet how it work, but maybe one of you did, so Um Yes. Do Do we have to say something about that? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh. Yes well we will then find out ho how it works. Um. Well, this seems to me, yes, some computer program but I didn't find it yet. So, we'll come to that later. So, uh now we will try out the white-board we have here. So, I would suggest uh Well, yes, um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way. I I'm not really sure how this works, but Yes, a good idea Mael. Okay. 'Kay. You you D doesn't it work? Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna, maybe you can start. Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right. So um L Why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board. Oh, I see uh Yeah. Yes. Mm. So draw it. We will try to guess what it is. Mm. It's like a cat, so I guess it's a cat. What is this now? So, that's the cat. Oh. It's a dog. So but that's also kind of cat, isn't it? B bo both predators. So, thank you. Uh d did you uh work out cord? Okay. Yes. Yes, yes this is Yes definitely a horse. Yes. Oh very good. So I suppose it Yes. Can you can meet them in Africa, I think. Yes. Very good. So Ma Matthew? So Maybe I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael. This looks likes a cat who has been driven over. Yes, the moustache. That's that's definitely a cat. It's quite, you know relaxed situation. Yes. Yes, okay. Th thank you, Matthew. Yes, this is certain uh some contribution to our project. So. Let's see. Which animal has not been drawn yet. So you've all drawn land animals, so why not draw an animal from the water. Mm. Yes. So Oh, yes, why not? Good idea. Why not. A swordfish. I hope it still works. So W Well, this uh this tool seemed to work. Let's continue to uh to the real stuff. Um our project uh finance uh thing. Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros, so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael, keep in mind uh uh uh People uh want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um product. Yes. Okay. Um more interesting for our company of course, p uh profit aim, about fifty million Euro. So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things. Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America, maybe some uh Asian countries. Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents. Yes, of course. Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit, huh? You all have to be paid. Excuse me? Yes, indeed. So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market, uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim, I think. So, that about finance. And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point, it has to be original, it has to be trendy, it has to be user friendly. Um, maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control. Yes, well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control. We wer we were thinking television. Uh. Mm-hmm. Yes, yes. Th th that's very handy I I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number, especially when you have a lot of channels. Yes. Yes. A and I'm Nanne. So Yes. So. Um S S s Are there some other very important things to to do well, to specify in this first phase of of the project. So the browse function, as you m mentioned. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Mm, well uh I I think Uh w y you two should should, I think, think this over uh w espec what, what functionality. Mm-hmm. Mm mm mm. Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit, so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out, I think. So twenty five Euro you expect a quite, well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control. Yes, but but but ab about the spec the buttons, the buttons uh that will be on it. I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting. Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting. So So you know now the basic the basic things. And well just just for the next meeting, um well, uh, you wor yes, work on a design, keep it general, I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions. So Um you will be working on on technical function design, so And uh you and you and uh uh uh well, think about requirements, eh? Does it need internet, or or do do we stay at basic basic television uh interface. So, uh I think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication. So next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh. K keep it in mind.
Speaker C: Hold that. Okay. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard, but they'll be recording what we write down. Mm. Mm. But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard. Mm-hmm. I have to draw. M my my favourite animal. Sorry this is all tangled up here. That's better. Mm-hmm. I'm a very bad drawer. Weird. Um. You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing. I'm a bad drawer. Okay. They're ears, by the way. No. Um close though. Okay so like a pet animal. Like a cat. No, not a cat though. Okay. So. It's not a cat, it's a dog. Yes. It's got a tail then. Yeah yeah. So do cats. And you guessed cats without a tail. Okay. Okay, there you go. So what favourite characteristics. Uh. Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun. A horse? This is why you're the designer. And I'm marketing. Ah Mm-hmm. That's it. A blue and black zebra. The very rare blue zebras. Yes. You got a lot of room here. You can probably reach. No? I took a dog. Um. A mouse? Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's a very big rat. Or a very small cat. Mm 'kay. Your turn. Ah I don't know what that is. It's a bit It's a bit hard to guess. Yeah. Mm-hmm Oh, it's a shark now. Mm. Now it's a swordfish. Swordfish. Um, maybe. I've never seen one, no. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. I'm marketing. Yep. Mm-hmm. Anna. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Oth yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. But Ninety percent of the time, ninety nine percent of the time, people will be using the main functions, the volume, the different channels, so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use. Mm. Mm. Mm. So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Speaker D: Okay. No I don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length. Okay, and then. Yeah, s yeah, um. I think you can put anywhere you want, actually. I thin It's not a directional mic, anyway. Uh. Yeah. Last. Okay. Okay. 'Kay. Alt F_ five. So. Yes. Total. Whitebo Yeah, you can start it you know. No they will record through that. There's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make. Yeah. Yeah. 's a cat. Yeah. Ah you forget about it. Yeah, uh I think it's fine. I just don't want to carry it off. Man, this wires, eh? We need a wireless microphone. You know? Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that. So. Oh the dog doesn't have a tail? Yeah, sure, yeah. I thought so. The dogs have a tail. Yeah. It'll still not extend, right? It's not up to that. It's a horse. Ah I think you can put that. I'll tell to get it off my Uh? Mm-hmm. Oh y it's not for that. No. Okay. Yeah. So what should I draw? Mm. He has already to do cat. So The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat? Ah it's a baby shark, it looks to me, you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish, no? You should go for the next one it seems to me. Twenty four. Ah yeah, the sale man, four million. They have to sell at least four million to make a profit Ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit. Fifty mill Of course it should have a on off button. Yeah, s and it depends what application you are using it for. You might need uh We are targ targeting the television set. So, you need to record the channels. You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way, Uh And Uh, and Marketing. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Oh. I'm Matthew. You know. Matth s uh Anna. And um uh Matthew, yeah. I thi think you know me, yeah? right yeah. So. So And uh, you'd need the usual ones, like the changing the volume, changing the the channel and then you uh Today we have uh um teletext and all those things. Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that, so Yeah I_P_O_ or. Now we are looking for television things or I_P_. For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up. Yeah. Ah it's it's it's it's coming up, actually. The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up. Let's Let's take Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know, you you sell their product as well as your product with them, you know. Yeah. No, it's okay, yeah I understand. So we need some numbering buttons, some teletext things and then um Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, we are alread mm. Mm. Yeah. L Yeah, sure. Stam. Okay.","we uh we will wait for Anna , a few minutes . I think you can put anywhere you want , actually . It's not a directional mic , anyway . So I will try to get my presentation running . Can't help you with that . Alt F_ five . Doesn't appear on the screen here . It's working .

Each of us is going . I I'm not really sure how this works , but shall I start ? I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down . Maybe maybe Anna , maybe you can start . Why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board . it's a dog . It's a horse . A blue and black zebra .

135,"Speaker A: I'm sorry. What was the where's the L_E_D_? Oh. Okay. Oh, there's no e okay. Okay. Sixty. Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think. Where you can have it it's like a five second input time. So as long as you hit them dada it should be fine. As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons. Was there so on the top there is volume and Channel up volume up. Okay cool. Yeah. It's the R_. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Oh it's nice. Oh I think I killed the five. I did. I killed the four. Oh god. Oh it smells good. Bravo You want the I don't know what order it goes in. I have one. Evaluation cri Okay. That's me. Hello. Oh there we go. Okay. Come on my computer. Come on. Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties. Should I press it again? Last time I did that it sh Okay. You're right. Oh. Still not there. Okay now I think for this one I could Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it. Um, we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen. Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings, um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were, um, back to our kick-off meeting this morning. Um, and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do. Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false. So basically the lower p the lower the points the better. Okay so question number one. Does the remote whoops. Sorry. Oh I'm not gonna be able um, I'll do it on the whiteboard. I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once. I'll write down our scores up on the Okay so number one. Do we have a fancy look-and-feel? Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy, but it's definitely different. It's not your traditional yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I kinda I like the potato look. It's very different. It's what? Oh sorry the mango the mango look. Yeah it is, fruit or vegetable depends on your mood. So I myself would say a one or a two. It's a two? Okay, and p One being true. So Two. Okay, actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing, like that. Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative. Use of the rubber, the use of the L_E_D_. Isn't Mm-hmm. Yeah. And I think I mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this, because then that would've defeated the purpose. So I mean I we'll put three, but I think we actually reached our goal. We didn't want it any more than that. Okay question number three. Uh, will it be easy to use? Yeah. Yeah. S Yeah I think it's you can't really get confused with that. I mean, there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system. But once that's figured out, it should be fine. Number four. Is this a good-looking remote? Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Mm-hmm. Whoops. Should just not touch it. This time it's the three I killed. I was just wondering if it should be like flatter. Or Well Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit. Oh. That's true. Maybe, it could it could be on the bottom, so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here, so it sits up. Like that. I g If it's weighted maybe. Details, details. Okay. So, is this a good-looking remote? Would we wanna show it off to our friends? Yeah. Yeah? I mean I gue yeah, it's personal taste, but Yeah. Okay, so should we say two for that? Yeah? Okay. Uh, question number five. What's um will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy. Mm-hmm. Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it. Shake it and the buttons fall off. No, I guess, I don't know much about the remote control industry, how much your average sells for, but I know I am, aren't I? But you don't have to buy batteries. So in the long term this can actually save you money. So we'll market it that way too. So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options, it'll Yeah. Okay number six. Can someone read it out? Or Um yeah. So that was mainly that the statistics we said Mm-hmm. Yeah I guess the I think the key word there is average, 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff. But they're not you and I really. So. Okay so one? Okay. Number seven. C Heather could you push it down? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly. Now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented? It turns into a duck and starts quacking. Here I am. Um Okay. We oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype. But yeah, it'll be there. So we can we could say that We can give it a one, because compared to every other remote ever m ever made, this one will be easier to find. Okay. Um Question number eight. Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult. So it has to be yeah, it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do. The plus thing needs to be worked on. Yeah. Well Do Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least. You could just press six enter, or one two enter. Yeah. Um, okay so we can we'll say yes it's uh one? Okay. Question number nine. Uh, will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_, which was repeated strain injury? Um, which affected over a quarter of users. S It's soft, and And people could Mm-hmm. I don't know what other options there are. Could I mean, you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger. But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard. So, I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control. So, one or two do you think? Two okay. Okay number ten. Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo? Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla? Is the yellow Mm-hmm. It sounds like the colour's something that we But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though, depending on the So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers, and see if we can get away with just the R_R_. Okay. Yeah. And the buttons in the middle. Okay. So, do you think that's more of a three then? Three, four? Four? Well we have good reasons for it, so we but we can still put a a four? Okay, and final question. Um, did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics? Current trends of fruits and veggies, desire for sponginess. Yeah. No, uh, are the plates interchangeable? I think I missed a few they are? So you can have banana and kiwi and okay. Okay, so that's something that's kind of in the making too, like maybe it'll become more Mm-hmm. Yes we do. So I wh what was I gonna put for that? A two for fashion? Okay, so our average there, five, six, eight, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fifteen, nineteen, twenty one, divided by eleven is Between okay. Um. Yeah, that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one. Does that seem right then? Okay. Sorry. Are you gonna do that? Okay. Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it? Or okay. Mm. 'S good. Mm-hmm. Yeah and the conceptual and functional. Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess, but m When we can down to it. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Good leadership, I think we stayed on task. Mm-hmm. And the timing was good. We never were pushed for time, or sat around doing nothing, so Was good teamwork. I think we are well-suited to our roles. Oh really? Okay. Yeah. The computer programmes are good. The Yeah. I don't think there was anything Yeah. They'll probably still be there. Um I'm not sure, new ideas found. Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other, which was cool. Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and yeah, worked well. Mm-hmm. Oh does it have smart materials by the way? Does it have smart materials? Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. By watching T_V_? Mm. Conclusion? Dadada.
Speaker B: Okay. Here we go. Alright, the agenda for thi oh. Alright. Um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers. And then we will evaluate it, given the criteria that um that we gave gave it. And um talk about our finances, whether we were under or over our budget. I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made, given our options. And um evaluate the product, as a group. And um So first we'll have the prototype presentation. Do you need the um PowerPoint for this? Alright. On? A mango. Okay. Oh. Okay. Oops. Yeah. Notice you have a number ten button. Okay. No problem. Ah. Oh. You press a plus button? Oh okay. I've never heard of that kind before. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. I But Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two? Yeah but I mean if you press, it'll go to that channel right away. 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards. Yeah I know, but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five, channel sixty five, if I press the six it'll go to channel six, and then I'll press the plus, and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five? I th Um Yeah it wouldn't be a problem. But I was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do. Yeah. C_ and V_. Right, where um where's the power button? Oh okay. Yeah. Yeah. Oh okay. Yeah. Ergonomic, definitely ergonomic. The spon yeah. Yeah. Bit of a stress ball feel. Yes. I would. My goodness. There you go. Genevieve? Yeah. And something hmm. Oh right. Yeah. It looks more Think like vanilla and banana would. Okay yeah. Kinda Christmas, you know. Yeah. Cool. Alright, thank you very much. Good work everyone. Alright. And so now that we've we have a prototype, uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle. So, I have something I'm going to Oh wait a minute. Do you need to do a presentation first? Yeah. I'm gonna check that out for a second. What time is it anyw Oh yeah sorry you're right. Evaluation criteria is next in line. Yeah. Just press um function eight again. And then again I think. One more time. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Ooh. Yeah. The look is a little bit more playful. Oh definitely different yeah. Oh you were only given red and black? Oh okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's mango. It's mango. Yeah. I would say two. Personally. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'd say maybe three. Yeah we want it simple. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. One. Th The plus number thing. Yeah colour will definitely be a factor. I think that the logo could be smaller. And maybe not such a prominent way. Maybe like at the bottom, kind of. Oh it just had to be on there I guess. I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand. Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat, and then the rest is like round. It would still be comfortable I think. We c we could handle it I think. Ah it'd fall over all the time though. It'd be annoying. 'Kay we're done designing. Come on. I think, it was another colour and it was like I think it'd look okay. I think maybe a two. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Durable. But you're our Marketing Expert. Oh. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. I would give it a two still though. Mm. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We have the alarm system. I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up. Or or was it gonna make a noise? You press the button it makes a noise right? Yeah. Awesome. Awesome. I though w it was gonna make a noise. Okay. Oh okay. Whoo. Okay. Yeah, totally. No problem, mm. Totally. Yeah. Yeah, so it's just like channel six, six, enter. Yeah but you don't have to press zeros. And then like twelve, enter. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. It's like right in the Your thumb might get a little bit uh Yeah. But it is soft. And that's kind of what the um the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_, so maybe it is but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes we did. Well, yeah the colours are yellow and grey. So it could be grey on the banana one. Yeah. Mm, yeah. Hum. I would say so. But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit, it's just sort of naming it by a fruit. With the with the colours. Yeah. Yeah. That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates. Be like Yeah. Maybe if it was scented. Yeah we have money for that. Um Alright so based on this evaluation, do we average them out sorta thing? Oh. I would say two. One point nine or something? I don't know these things. Um, between one and two. Alright. Yeah. I'm attempting to do that right now. Yeah it is one point nine. Ooh. Go Heather Pauls. Yeah. Alright, now with that over and done with, our next step is to see if we are under budget. And um my computer's frozen. And now it's not. Okay. So um in our shared folder, if everyone could go there right now, um I'm going to um steal a cable. Um it's it's um it's an Excel file. Oh. Yeah. 'Kay there we go. Um, production costs. And um I have to access that as well. One moment. 'Kay so far I've added what I think or what is going on? Great. It's blinking at me. It's locked for editing. Read only. I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing. I have the original in my um my email account. I dunno. No. No, I was hoping that you guys could. Um, there we go. Okay here we go. So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing. So um if you can look up at the screen, um the large screen, oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think. Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros. Um we're using a regular chip. Um, it's cur it's double curved, so its curved all around. That's another three. We're already at five. Um, we're using plastic and rubber, so Good thing plastic is free, we're at eight. Um S Yeah. I guess we should do it just for one kind. So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours right? Well one colour for the case, one colour for the buttons. So we can Um, we have push button interface, so that's inexpensive. And um we have a special colour for the button, and we also have a special form. And a special material. Which puts us just barely under budget. Hurray. Yeah. Good work guys. So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros. Awesome. And back to our PowerPoint. So we've 'Kay. Yes we are. So we need to do a product evaluation, again, which is probably um I dunno. A different extension of a Hmm. Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership, teamwork. Yeah. Alright so um Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity? Pushed for creativity? Ye Okay. So it'd be like need more time and materials. But you were allowed m creativity? I think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ Right. Right Okay Great. Leadership? Is this me being like, guys do you like me? Um. Yeah. Yeah. Oop Okay. Teamwork? I think we worked great as a team. Yeah? Alright how were our means? We needed more Play Doh colours. Yeah. But ever everything else was satisfactory? Is that good Yeah? New ideas found. I don't really know what that means. Hmm? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Each other's Mm. Okay? Well with that achieved, our last slide is our closing slide. Yes our costs are within budget. It's evaluated generally positively. And um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary. Then we celebrate in such a way that I have no idea. Alright? Okay, bye.
Speaker C: Okay. Um yeah. I just got a few slides, so show them. Thank you. Do you want to present it? Yeah, here we are. Mango shape. The L_E_D_. So it's palm-held. Yeah. You just need the nought. So one plus one would be eleven, or Yeah because if you on your average um remote, if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve, you press one, and then you go to channel one, and then two then you'd just go to channel two, instead of twelve. So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve, or two plus two is channel twenty two. Oh. Well I don't mind, we can further define that. I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first, in like on the way to channel sixty five. But I suppose it's not as snappy. Yeah. Yeah. If you don't put it Yeah. Yeah, that yeah. Mm-hmm. Um And channel, which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it, like It's the bigger R_. So it's just like. We deci Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb. Uh e ergonomics are all considered. Yeah. It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though. But yeah, no I mean it's a different movement so yeah. Um and the feel of it, I mean, we've made this out of Play Doh, which is representing the, you know, the rubber, and the spongy rubberness. Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it, and it just feels feels different. Would you like to feel it yourselves? How it fits in the palm of your hand? Thanks. And you? O Okay, as for the colours, we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype. But we're thinking that, seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway, that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use. Or the combination. Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme, the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit, like banana could be black and yellow, watermelon red and green, or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish. Banana's more representative of our colour scheme, like the company the yellow and black. So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength. I mean watermelon, you know, m probably appealing to the yeah, seasonal. Apple green, brown, more kinda trendy, you know, khaki Yeah. Okay. Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device, I mean you don't need to use both hands, one hand to hold this and type in with the other, you can just use your thumb. Um, as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it. Mm-hmm. Mm go Feel I think. We've been quite successful with the rubber coating and Yeah. I think the colour has a lot to do with it. I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen. It's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek red, black and yellow, and orange. Um But if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something Well I know know it's for rubber. I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy. Oh well, potato, mango, fruit and veg. Potato's fine. Potato's fine. Yeah. Totally. It's really adaptable. For the fancy I uh two, three. Yeah and the use of the rubber. For the anti-R_S_I_. The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons, it's all pushbuttons, there's no L_C_D_ control, so if we're thinking about the rest of the market, it's sort of probably halfway. In some aspects it is, like we said. Yeah. Though it was our specification. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and perhaps the turning on but Mm. Again I think the colour comes into this. Okay. Not in Don't worry. I suppose I've got quite big hands. Thing is like that, it's not going anywhere particularly. Yeah. Uh yeah, it's less um, what's th ha. H it's got higher centre of gravity like that. I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that, but definitely in another colour, I'm not happy with those colours. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the kinetic energy, shaker-style-y, whoo, ooh no. But you know, those'll be firmly on. Mm, yeah, that's true. Yeah. Good point. Yeah. Yeah. Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user. Yeah. Because yeah, because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing. And it's just you won't have to think about it. You don't have to look down to find them. They're clearly there, easy to use. Simple. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. It Yeah l lights on and, or flash as well. But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm. Yeah. But when the alarm's not yeah. If you Yeah. You could s Yeah. Well the thing is, if it was had an alarm system, I mean, when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went. But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something, there wouldn't be any point. So you can't see the alarm, but it would light up. Yeah. Alarm, but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself. Yeah. Yeah. It w yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Sorry Heather. That wasn't very clear. Yeah I think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons, I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use. Mm. And or sixty six enter, y Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward. Yeah. Good Ooh. Mm. Oh. Injury. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I think we're getting that's true. Mm. I think yeah, I think too. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I think this is the the factor that we've been least successful in confronting. Yeah. Four I think. Well I don't what do what Okay. Yeah. Like um the colour scheme names and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is. The thing is, I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from, I don't know if you'd instantly say mango. Oh yeah. There we go. That would be great. Um Okay. It's Between one and two. So that's pretty fantastic. Mm. It seems like it should be more around two. Do we have an online calculator? Okay. Oh wow. Well done. Well that's excellent. Production costs. It says it I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now. Have you have you completed it? Oh right. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Double double-curved yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oof. Congratulations guys. Of the actual project rather than the product? A project? Is is yeah. So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it. I think we were pushed. I mean we weren't really given a lot of time, or materials, yeah, to go about our design task. So I think we could've done with a bit more time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen, and like solar power backup and everything, then we wouldn't have been able to afford that. So that did limit creativity. Just resources. But yeah. The fruit and veg idea. Yeah we did. We've, uh seeing as we've come out with what we intended. A pro um a product within the budget. I think that's a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way, so you know I think it's been fine. Yeah. Good timing. And project manager of course. Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah and more Play Doh, 'cause that was all the red we had. So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype, we wouldn't have been able to. Yeah. It could be really straightforward for the computer. I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays but I think I was the only one who struggled with that. Mm. Uh me too. Yeah. Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other, like the n um yeah. Just about each different. Got new ideas from each other. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry? Oh yeah. Well mm, did it come into the into I dunno if we counted that in the costs. Yes. Uh. Fantastic. Okay, brilliant. Thank you very much.
Speaker D: Um This is what we came up with. It's a pretty simple design. It's um based on a mango? Yeah. And we Yeah. And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and this'll be the power point, the on off button kind yeah. It's in the middle of one of the little R_s. And then the other one is the power. And uh we just have a simple design. We wanted it all to be accessible from your thumb yeah palm-held and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb. So you don't have to Oh that was a mistake, wasn't it? Right no, that's a zero. Take that one off. Sorry. I was in charge of the numbers. And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus. You can go one, three or something. You press that first and then you go one three yeah. Well we just thought, we have all the numbers here, so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and So the plus and then yeah. No no, th all that's why we have all these numbers. These numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine. Yeah. Oh no. Uh, the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine. You p Oh. No you press the plus first. I I well it doesn't we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five, but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler? It's a Yeah. Yeah. Oops. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So A channel. Just so we can flick It's in the middle of one of the little R_s. Yeah, so it's all accessible. Without m taking your hand off the remote. And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of Play Doh yeah. 'Cause it'd be quite subtle and Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of, and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor. Yeah. Mm. Well Yeah. Yeah. Yeah so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey. So we want it to be stand out that way, anyway. Yeah. A metallic-y finish we were thinking. Polished. Okay Yeah. We we were we were thinking about yeah. I w I'd say two I think. Fanciness. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. I'll go for three as well. No. Wouldn't be simple, yeah. Yeah. Yeah very. I think one for that. Yeah. No. Yeah that's the only thing yeah. It's definitely Yeah. But the Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent. Yeah. Yeah. But you know what I've just thought of there now. What where's it gonna sit in your living room? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa? Yeah. But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand. Yeah. Oh that would be nice. Yeah. Three. You would though, 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes. Yeah. Yeah. I think we have to market it in the right way, that um to say that it is simplistic. So people don't just see it and think, uh, this is so simplistic, I don't want to spend twenty five Euros. We have to market it. And the kinetic energy part. Yeah. Don't shake Oh no the plus. You're use the zero. Make a new one. I think they're about ten po ten pound, aren't they? About ten pounds. Fifteen? Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I think it does very well. The zap yeah. Uh Yeah. Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system, the lights behind the and it'll vibra It'll be again in the marketing. Yeah. The light it will. But But both Yeah. Oh, that would be brilliant. I'd be tempted to Yeah. It would have to be in the market Yeah but you still couldn't see it. It would just be a little speaker on the back or something. So the plu the plus w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple, won't it? Yeah. That kind of annoys me though, when it's zero six when you have to press I don't know why. Oh okay. Right. Alright, aye. Yeah. I'd say w yeah one. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. But if you're zapping yeah. I don't think it will f Yeah, the biology. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I I'd say t two. Yeah. Yeah. N We we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow. It won't stand out. So n it's not always gonna be the same colour. Gray, yeah. Yeah, could be grey. Yeah that's right, we didn't even rea Yeah. Perhaps a metallic or or like that's grey, and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal. No? That isn't rubber. Okay. Following that briefing we did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think w yeah, I think one. Well that was our brief and we followed the brief. Well we haven't got a big banana but Oh yeah. No. No. Oh that would be class. Yeah. Two. It's Yeah. Close to two. Yeah. I got Yeah, 'cause we've a four to bring down. Uh, aye. Yeah. Uh, should've added five. This is. Yay. Is that the project document? Yeah. Oh right. What about a special colour? Are we using that? Yeah. And a special material. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. The ma Or materials. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Creativity. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it c it might've been bigger. Yeah. I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations. Yeah. Through discussion. Yeah. And we were a able to modify each other's ideas to fit in with our areas of expertise. If if it if it If it can be afforded. Yeah. Yay. Yeah.","The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. The designers give the prototype presentation, showing their simple design that is based on a mango. They point out the company logo and LED, and demonstrate how the device is palm-held and thumb-acessible. They also discuss the numerical, volume, channel, and power buttons as well as the color scheme. The marketing expert administers the product evaluation, and they rate each of the ten criteria on a scale of 1-7. The criteria includes fancy look-and-feel, technological innovation, ease of use, look, whether people would be willing to spend 25 Euros for it, whether its operating behavior matches the average user, ease of finding when lost, ease of learning to use, whether it will minimize RSI, incorporation of company colors and logo, and whether it follows the motto. They average the scores and get 1.9. They check the product costing and find that their operating cost is 12.20 Euros. In evaluating the project process they are pleased with their creativity, leadership, timing, teamwork, discussions, and overall product given the resources they had. They close the meeting by thanking one another."
105,"Speaker A: So is Why not save that. Do you want to replace existing file, no. I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents, but spreadsheet. Yeah, but I've ta uh right, I'll just re-do it. That's the easiest way. Right. R right. Um, all these things have cost implications. And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button. So However, I've now. But um, yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that, and uh as I suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours, would be uh open to debate, I suppose. An important consideration. Right, okay so um And the second one underneath would be the idea for the Right, okay. So we've got um detail design meeting. Right. So So, we've got prototype presentation, which we've just done, evaluation criteria, um and finance, so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting. So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer, but um obviously obviously it would. But other than that, we got the red apple. We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons, and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance. And the and the cost implication. The only snag about this is that uh the cost is probably kind of important. So um, and then the production evaluation, as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture. Um, and whether it would uh Right, so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half Euros. So, there's no redesign. So that should uh Right, so, seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that uh Right. Okay. Right.. Okay, so, by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source, we've got a single curved case. We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements. So, we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and Okay. W the button supplements. Well, originally, I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple. But So the so the real w the real question then would come in. Do you make all the buttons O Well, so we've got one special button form, which was the apple. Everything else is gonna be a standard. We've got special material, rubber, wood, titanium, et cetera and that, so, I was originally, I was thinking rubber wasn't special, but according to this, maybe it is. So And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there. W I don't know is is is the sort of answer, is that meant to be all sixteen buttons, and therefore I mean, what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons, but just to have the one that was soft and spongy, and therefore Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber, whereas the rest would be hard plastic. Mm. I would Every design change is uh I dunno, um Okay, um, if we just had all the buttons as standard, except for the one red apple, then that would take care of that, I guess. We'd have one special colour and one special button form. And when I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half. As far as I know, that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements. And if What happened? Now, right. Okay, so, but the point would be that if we uh if we just did special Sorry, you were saying that it would be that one, that you would put in one there. Okay. So it Well, is it s is no, it's nine point seven I've got. Okay. So, that would that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons, then that would be fine. And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on. Uh-huh. Well, hold on. Um, if we Okay, that gives us twelve point seven But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the Oh, I see, so just take out the special colour for the apple and And go for battery instead. That would give you one less. But you reckon that i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries. Mm-hmm. But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options? In a sense, at the moment, we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two. At least. Remember that was a minimum requirement. The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful, would be to um make it originally, we're gonna make it a simple product. Mm-hmm. Makes sense.. Sorry, do you want that back up? Right. Okay, but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost. Go for one. Yep. Okay. Yeah, why not not, m m maybe nearer three. Two three. Well, it's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down, we've got solar power, we've got uh various other things you could have, and we're not going for these options. Mm-hmm. Okay. No. 'Cause you can't afford that w we took that out too. Didn't you? Or Well, wait a minute. In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic. The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five. And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic. So, it's very much dependant on what you do with your options. And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker, then because that the other functions we've got in are are more at the The special material, the rubber, wood, titanium, et cetera, if you go for that, th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six, whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two. Now you're trying to lose one point two, so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker, you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else. And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery, to have your uh sample sensor speaker, and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two, which would be come from the button supplements category. Um, interface type um, well plastic rather than rubber. That that that would make the significant difference. You could either you could have it If you have a in plastic rather than rubber, then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then, you could keep your sample sensor, and you'd be looking to take out point two. So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom, or your special colour at the bottom. And that would enable you to to do it. Yeah. Ye Well, okay, but It's rubber as it is, yes. We got we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically, we're going to reduce down from that. But the current one, you'd say would be fancy, would be too Mm-hmm. I would've said about a two as well. Oh. The next on Well, I can just sing about. Easy to use. I would've said yes. I would go for a one on that at this point in time. Um, incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer. Well, yeah it certainly has some.. Yep. I don't know. Yep. Yeah, I woulda said two would seem reasonable. The product is a recognisable real r uh reaction product? Oh. S Okay. So we're going for a two, three? Sure. Right, okay. Two. Right, come on. That's that decided. Right. So So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements, and then About a two. Two. Yep. Two b two b two, yeah. Yes. Well, you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements. Okay, well I put it back on. Yes, I would've thought so. Okay, so what was it, control uh F_ eight, wasn't it? Oh. Oh. How kind. Right, okay. So, you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic, right, you've got a choice there of going down to battery, which would save you one. You've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker, which is your big item. That's right. Which gets you Yes. Alright. Okay, so So we're going for plastic, yes? Yep. Well, uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them. You got special colour. Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple, and therefore, that was the special colour. Well, we've got special form. Now that would be one button, and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button. 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special So so no matter how you look at that, that would be the same. The other thing would then be special material, rubber, wood, titanium. Alright. So, special colour, you want three in there. Okay. That makes sense. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I would agree with that, I think. So special colours, two. And we've got special form is the one apple. The rest are all standard, although you could argue that should maybe be You were making these buttons down the bottom, I was presuming, bigger than the other ones, or were you? Was that the idea? Uh-huh. I would have thought that's probably about r well. Right. Yep, that makes sense. Yep. I woulda said so. Yeah. So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two. Real Reaction produ I'm not quite sure, what does that mean? Yep I would s You mean of Well you could argue you might do it once a year, you would change, because at the moment you're making a red apple. So next year you could make next year's model the same, but have it as a a yeah whate whatever, a lemon. Yeah, l a lemon lemon or something. And that amount Yeah, we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it? We've Well, ease has certainly stayed. Yeah. And the speech feature. How it would play out, yeah. Oh. Well, but you've got the company logo on there, which would effectively be a stick-on badge. So you're in a sense, you're comparing the product without the company logo. And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on. Don't think so. But but i but in the sense that, as you saw with um the Windows logo badge, it doesn't really matter. There's virtually n The way that you frame, you know, the Windows badge on there, it really doesn't matter what colour it is, so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline. Fact, they've got black and white or black and silver. So basically, even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display, because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo, it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product. And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it. You could put in another Well, in this one, you've actually got three colours of buttons. Well, we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour. So you were talking about uh um We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel, the hidden away panel, would all be standard. Which m may or may not be the case. Well, yeah. Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know, on the second page, as it were, that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour? Yeah, well Alright. Okay. So we just add that to profitability in effect. Right, so we're meant to finish up in five minutes. Mm-hmm. So we're okay this way around. Until the design team comes in and says, get off. But you are the design team. So what bit are we on to? Yeah. I th I th Oh. Right, okay. Oh drats, I've botched that, haven't I. Right, okay um What's happened here? Right, okay um Mm. Right, okay um, Right. So we got So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign. So we're now on to project process. Now satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means, et cetera, whiteboard, digital pens, et cetera. So, we're actually now uh, in a sense, on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it. So what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain. So, um So I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down, which I will do. So, uh I think I have to finish that page. Right, okay, so Project evaluation. So, um Creativity. Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough? Well um Individual meetings. How do you mean? In you on your own. Um Mm, The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process, you would normally, you go to a meeting, you decide, right, you do this, you do that, you do that. Then you go away. You find out information. You then come back. You then discuss it. You then go and change things around, and then go back. So Whereas, this time, you're really getting it from a database source, so it's not uh well uh Anyway, so, what do you want to put down? I've put, seemed okay. Creativity, seemed okay. Um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed. Um Have could have used a different example pel to increase create Creativity. You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing, so I th I uh d But the other thing is that uh they're I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project. I mean, m my wife at the moment, for instance, is uh acting as a computer um for um you normally, you got a problem, so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed. So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question. And then you or the idea is that the whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction, show them where to either give them directly give them help, or secondly, point them in the right direction, either at the library, or uh or or come back, or go and see Joe Bloggs, or whatever. So uh, and that was a project I suspect similar to this, because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um to enable it to work. And of course, you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong. So Alright, so we've got uh New ideas found, did we find any, no. Alright. Leadership, teamwork. Does You've got voice recognition computers, that's not remote controls. Mm-hmm. Okay, so how do you reckon teamwork went? To uh go uh reasonably well. Okay. Bit bit arbitrary. Mm-hmm. So, we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means, E_ G_ whiteboard, digital pens, et cetera. And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing. Now, I'd much rather be in marketing but I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked. However, um Alright uh means, so whiteboard um so really, it's uh equipment. Oh. Right. New ideas found, so one or two. um and uh voice uh, was it voice activated um recognition. Right, so, uh are the costs within budget, yes. Is the project evaluated, yes. Uh, don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary. Then celebration. Yeah. Uh, so we don't re So really I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three, and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere. Mind you, the the figure last was was different, but it should be poss
Speaker B: No, you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere. Yeah, you have to you have to close that window. 'Cause that's the save one isn't it, so And then find it. You pass it round to have a look. Mm very nice. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So it is, yeah. Cherry would be alright actually. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Copyright, yeah. What's this this one? What's that one there? Oh, okay. Right. Uh-huh. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'll see if I can find them. Have Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. So if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype? That's the pr Okay. we should plug it in. Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one. We could do it as we d go along, the production costs, looking at the prototype. Well do we'll do it on the prototype, so do two, see how much it is. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think you just do one, don't you, for the I think I think it's just it's just a one. Else I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material, rather than per button. I don't know though. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You've just gone off the window into another one. It's on the bottom row. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we have to have it Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first, and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after? Okay. Right um, I have a little thing. So, we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven, isn't it, with everything we want on. Yeah, I just had a presentation to do. Mm-hmm. Mm. Right okay um, This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here. And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype, and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated. And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research, and also finance, I guess. And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven, so if it's neither true nor false, then that's four. So, I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well, at the end. Um so, We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy. Um The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation. Whether it's easy to use. Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer. And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product. And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently, so I'll go over here. Right. So the first one is um, does the product look and feel fancy. So if we do a sort of a one So Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of but I think What Is one false, or is t one true? I forgot. One's true, and okay. Seven's fal Four is neutral, okay. So Right. Okay. Right. I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space. So, false is seven, true is one, and So uh say about a two for fancy, you think? Okay. Okay, well d you do an average at the end, I don't know. Um Uh-huh. This this is just this is just for like the look. Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional. So Yeah, so that so sh should we go for a a two on that? 'Kay. And I mean, how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon? D yeah. Okay. So, what about the pr The prototype as it is, we've got we've got the speech recognition on it, haven't we. But not the kinetic. Alright, so So it doesn't It's pretty The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the Okay. Yeah. Right, okay. Mm-hmm. S I'm just gonna check my email. I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product. Okay. But I Okay. Yeah., I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is, I think, so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design. I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or. So, I mean does this need to go up a bit or something, 'cause we've got both the both the um the speech Yeah. Yeah. Um, for for innovation, so we've got the speech the speech thing, and Do you reckon a two? Okay. Two. And the next one is I'll have to get it back up now. Okay. Um Say about a three maybe? It's a two. Yeah, this is This Yeah. So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing, as well as having the logo on and all that. So sort of Is it sort of a recognisable product. Does it fit in with our other other products, which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft. What do y Yeah. Uh-huh. So Two or three? Yeah. Two or three. How Two. Okay. Right. Yeah. Yeah we s yeah, I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be I'm just gonna do this in my head. One point eight isn't it or something. I think, anyway. So yeah, pretty close to a two. So So it's I mean it's pretty good at the moment, but it's gonna get worse, isn't it. But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad. Yeah. Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances I'm not sure. Yeah. it's come on already. Mm. Yeah. Different different colours, yeah. Yeah, I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case. Lose a little bit on the fashion, yeah, but And then Yeah. Yeah. Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements, you know. One original colour and then sort of two supplements, I think maybe. Okay. So we only ne we only need two for that. 'Cause I mean these these are moulded. The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber, isn't it. Right. Yeah, that Yeah. Okay, so tha So shall we do a Well, um Yeah. Yeah, so Uh So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button, then maybe they could be a different shape. Like we got a cherry one. Maybe other ones could be something else shaped. I don't know. That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different seeing as we've got, you know, we've made it a a special form, so And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one. And it would sort of, you know, keep it quite fancy as well, I don't know. Well you could Yeah. Yeah, I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something, maybe. Okay. So, we've what have we what have we rid of. We got rid of the plastic. Is it The rubber. Yeah. Yeah. But uh So I mean, we've got we got rid of the rubber case, but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form, and an extra colour for the buttons. So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability, we're pretty much the same, maybe. So, I mean we could maybe put two again on them. Yeah. Yeah. And what about the sort of innovation? Do you think Okay. And then, the corporate identity. Yeah. Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity, I don't know. I mean, it's maybe not. I mean Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, well I mean We cou Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, what what what's the company colour? Did you get told what the company colour is or Oh right. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Uh-huh. 'Cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to. Another colour. Or would that be t Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Shall we save the point two for profitability then? Hmm. Yeah. I mean it's the sort of thing that, I mean, you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume. So, if it's dead obvious, then that's fine. But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning, then you're paying a bit more attention. So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important. 'Cause you Yeah. So Yeah, I mean so we've dropped the cost, but Same sort of function? The criteria? It's alright. Just made a load of money. Well, but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber, we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons. le lemon sh I think well, we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something. Or something like that. Yeah. Did did you have to have a rubber case, though, for rubber buttons? Or was it the other way around? Right, okay. Yeah. So that so we've saved Saved two Euros on that. Mm-hmm. Well, we're aiming for um one for all of them. M but it really has to fit into the budget, so I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the Which is fair enough. Yeah. Yeah, I think most Yeah. Yep. I don't know. What's on the agenda? Uh-huh. Finish your meeting now. Yeah. Okay. Oh. I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary. Yeah. Well, we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings, and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one, you know, sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where, you know, you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness, but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons, and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that. You know, you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the thing itself. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control, in a way. I mean it depends what sort of business you're in, I guess. I mean this one seems. From the website it looks it's quite innovative, but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's, you know, fifteen quid. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean if you look at their products on their website here, Real Reaction, I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge. And Yeah. Yeah. we did find a new idea, I mean sort of a kinetic remote control. I've never seen one of them before. batteries, I think. So Mm yeah. Yeah. Mm. That went okay, yeah. Mm-hmm, yeah. I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything Well, I mean I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products. I mean, they've got all these sort of, you know, high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens, and uh I'm thinking, do you know, one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in. Surely they they should produ Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It worked. Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but I think there's a little there's a little um chi There's a little there's a little chip, I think you must plug it into something and it produces a I don't know. Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something, and Page after page. Yeah. Kinetic powered remote control. Um, what was the other one? Vo yeah. Voice recognition, yeah. S Almost. To fill in these fill in these questionnaires Oh no. Hmm? I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting.
Speaker C: Well we've made our prototype anyway. We can have a good look at that. Mm-hmm. Y no, it's a slightly curved around the sides. Um, it's almost curved like up to the main display as well. And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down. And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line. And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on. Yeah, it's a bit more fun, isn't it? And it's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple, you think computers, like Apple Mac. Yeah, and cherries are fun, summery. Ah, that's the mute. It it'd probably have to be labelled mute. But um, we didn't have anything small enough to write. Yeah. Uh, we just chose simple shapes for all them. Um, the important ones are the volume ones. So we made them a bit bigger. The mute could possibly be a bit smaller. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus. Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important, but we didn't have any white Play-Doh. So that's where the colour buttons came from. Uh, that's it. Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box. Yeah. S Um,. D wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well? You know how you turn that one to a zero, wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things, so you need both of them? I think the voice recognition. But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery. Yeah, I'd maybe give it a a two. One's true. And a four is neutral. Yeah, 'cause we haven't got the double curve, so we can't like say it's completely true. But it's pretty close. We've got almost everything we can. Yeah. Yeah, I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit. Maybe a three. I would give it more than a four. How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much. If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough. And then it stand the test of time better. Mm-hmm. Well, I suppose it's rubber as it is, isn't it. Yeah. Yeah, two or three. I'd be happy with a two. Yeah. Yeah, I would say so as well. Yeah, it's got the cherry and the sponginess. Maybe two? Yeah, that's a bit rough at the minute. Uh, well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine. Yeah, two or three. Well, the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing. It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper. But um, I think the logo would definitely be recognisable. And it does have attributes that other products do. Two? Aye. Go for it. What does what do all them numbers mean then? Do we add them up and rate or anything? we'll probably have to re-rate it. Ah it's on. Yeah, I think that'd be fine. Because that was just a trend, and we do have rubber buttons anyway. Yeah. Yeah, I think we should just imagine white buttons. Yeah. Yeah, the volume ones should stand out a bit. Real Reactions? Yeah, I don't see how we could make it any more. Um, apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue, like the casing. But then what colour would you make the R_s? No, I just We got the logo off the web browser. Mm-hmm. Um, I don't think they would really need to be. I think if they were just all small round blue buttons, it'd be fine. Needs to be an enter button, but could just be the same as well. Mm-hmm. Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion, go to a three? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel. 'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all. Alright. Did we decide what that was, which button it was? On the volume ones? Right. Um, can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple? Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac? And did we make it a cherry officially? Right. So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale? Right. So do we have anything else to discuss? Huh. Yeah. I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project. I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing. I can't think of a better example at the minute. Well it's a different application of it. Yeah. Well leadership's a bit of a funny one, isn't it. But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager. You were the leader. So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours. Yeah, very nice. But I mean, I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these. I mean, they record what you're writing, and then what do you do with it? Where do you get the recording? Do you plug the computer or something? Right. I think you watch a video of it kind of. Voice um recognition thing. Pretty much.
Speaker D: We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top. Yeah, yeah, we might get a For the M_. They're thinking For the first time, well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons. Hum, you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons, so you've got the volume in orange on design there, and the the channel is in blue. Yeah, sis Yes, we'll have the slide-away. Bottom. Mm-hmm. Yes, yes. Okay. Mm-hmm. This this is a yes, this is our presentation of the prototype. Mm-hmm. Could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there? 'Kay, Alice. So, sh 'Kay this should be then. Mm-hmm. Have a push button interface. Um Um Yeah. And then we'd have So that's nine point one there so we've got some 'Kay. Just give us a bit of I switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor. At the moment we've just got the simple chip, which costs one. Um, I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing, which puts up to four? We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard, and maybe go with the one the special form buttons, then we could have the speech So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours, kept them all the same colour, then we could have the voice recognition without Yeah, yeah. Um Oh possibly, yeah, yeah maybe. Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic. Um We should Yeah, that would save us one, though we'd still be slightly ov Yeah, yeah. Well, since it's the through the whole technology type thing, um, you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them. Um, whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker, voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have. And then still have the batteries, or whatever they would prefer not uh You know what I mean? The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote. So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, well we have a single curve, which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good. So uh Um, then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel, which was in at the time. Um, sorry that'd be considered fancy. So maybe maybe a two. Yeah. Um, deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition, and if we had either of those for our budget, they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition. Um But not the kinetic. Like the power. No, we c ca yeah, we can't afford both. No may is maybe about neutral plus it it it's got something, but it hasn't got Right. Okay. 'Kay. Okay. Um Mm-hmm. So it says if we make a slightly more fancy, then we lose points innovation, and if we make it more innovative innovative, then we lose points on it being fancy, so Yeah, yeah. Um It does, yeah. Yeah, m um Yeah, it was just doing it quite well. Um, I think we're gonna have to lose some of these, but the moment, as it stands, it's um Uh the sensor using all of its all of its products, all of its buttons, and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from. Okay. Also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age. Um, it depends which way you look at it. Maybe a kind of three? Uh d Yeah, so it's So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has. Okay, so we need to So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it? Yeah, yeah we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going. Oh actually we just have a plastic case, then we lose two points, which gets us um In right within the budget range. So that's eleven point seven, and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements. Possibly, yeah. Um And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations. So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of Oh yeah, and that would now be Yeah, that's that's within the budget. Um Do we actually have Do we just have one special uh special forms down here? Um And we we've we've got we've got enough for another we've got nought point eight left, so we've got enough for another Yeah, um But the but but but the I think maybe the special colour, we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different, I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour. Yeah, which I think we should Yeah, they'll still be fine for the for the price. Okay, uh that's probably it. Ne uh Maybe that'll be a second supplement. Then there's a spe a second special form. Um Well you got you got twelve. So I think that should still be okay. Yeah, that's twelve point three, so we're still within budget on that. Um So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it, but generally speaking, we've kept the other attributes to the That's without Yeah. And specially it definitely could fits the the real product What was the what's the company name? R yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company, then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on Um Mm-hmm. Yeah so it's a Whatever fruit was in fashion next year. That yeah, that was uh that was just about all. I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface, which is by far the cheapest. Um So maybe in a sense not having that, maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side? I dunno. And that is like the most standard type of button. Yeah. And everything else has stayed pretty much the same, so Yeah, plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use. Um, well we've still got the kinetic energy. Um Yeah, the speech feature. I think we've cut just about the same. We've maybe lost Hasn't it It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect Um But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics, but But either way, I think we've made it fairly close to what just the the company logo. So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I'm still not quite sure we've established that. Yeah. Um Yeah, maybe we've m Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time, we make it look good, and um, fit the kind of idea of what they want. And then for the more functional buttons, we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway, you're not gonna see it at the start. Yeah. 'Kay. Uh,. That's good. Definitely lemon shaped. You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case. So I think we can we're okay. Then we say it's fine, so it's all good. Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like. And we seem to have least something in each criteria. We haven't completely left anything out, so As an overall product which has to be quite cheap, we've just about achieved everything. We've got the closing. We should just go through this quickly and then Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant. Is this go It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on. one of those things. Like uh, companies can have like a range of products and I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of Yeah. Well, sh we look at the last slide, see if it's got anything else. I think there's one one more to go. It was quite good with this um the white board, having that and the digital pens. Like, that's something that made it a little easier. voice recognition, especially not could Yeah. Yeah, so it's just like the same products, but just put together in a different way. Um Yeah, I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them. So it's not just for us, it's for the experiment as a whole, so Should we quickly look at the last slide? Sh. Is that everything?","Well we've made our prototype anyway . You pass it round to have a look . Y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides . Um , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top . Cherry would be alright actually . Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . For the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons . Uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them . Um , the important ones are the volume ones . So we made them a bit bigger . Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there , and the the channel is in blue . And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . so uh but there would be a cost implication on that , Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important , but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . Yes , we'll have the slide-away . and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . And the and the cost implication . So um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture . Right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half Euros . We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . Okay . W the button supplements . Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , so , I was originally , I was thinking rubber wasn't special , So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic . I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button . So , that would that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . So that's nine point one there I switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor . At the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one . Um , I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? We should be slightly over our budget Okay , that gives us twelve point seven So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic . i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries . The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote . So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them . But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? I think the voice recognition . The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it originally , we're gonna make it a simple product . Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? So , we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on . But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . Um The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use . Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . Okay , well we have a single curve , Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two . What Is one false , or is t one true ? One's true . So uh say about a two for fancy , And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? Um , deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so I would go for a one on that at this point in time . Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . it's got the cherry and the sponginess . Say about a three maybe ? The product is a recognisable real r uh reaction product ? I woulda said two would seem reasonable . and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . Two . But um , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , What does what do all them numbers mean then ? Do we add them up and rate or anything ? I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be I'm just gonna do this in my head . One point eight isn't it or something . So yeah , pretty close to a two . So it's I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ? I'm not sure . we'll probably have to re-rate it . If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has . Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements . You've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item . which gets us um In right within the budget range . and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements . Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case . So we're going for plastic , yes ? Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons . Do we just have one special uh special forms down here ? You got special colour . Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple , we've got nought point eight left , Well , we've got special form . Now that would be one button , 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . So , special colour , you want three in there . Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe . You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , And we've got special form is the one apple . the volume ones should stand out a bit . Maybe that'll be a second supplement . Then there's a spe a second special form . Yeah , that's twelve point three , So I think that should still be okay . So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two . so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company , then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . Maybe other ones could be something else shaped . And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you're making a red apple . So next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon . Yeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe . we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ? So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them . And what about the sort of innovation ? Um , well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um And the speech feature . But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but But then what colour would you make the R_s ? Um , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing . Well , but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick-on badge . Did you get told what the company colour is or I'm still not quite sure we've established that . so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . So basically , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to . Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ? I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine . And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway , I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important . Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? Well , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons . well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . And did we make it a cherry officially ? Yeah . As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything . So do we have anything else to discuss ? So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign . So we're now on to project process . Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do . Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough ? I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary . Well , we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings , and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . Then you go away . You find out information . You then come back . You then discuss it . Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source , what do you want to put down ? Creativity , seemed okay . Um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed . I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing . But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . I mean this one seems . From the website it looks it's quite innovative , It was quite good with this um the white board , having that and the digital pens . so how do you reckon teamwork went ? That went okay , yeah . I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them . To uh go uh reasonably well . I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything Bit bit arbitrary . Well , I mean I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . we did find a new idea , I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . voice recognition , especially not could You've got voice recognition computers , that's not remote controls . Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way . But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours . I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked . Alright uh means , so whiteboard um so really , it's uh equipment . Oh . Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but But I mean , I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these . I mean , they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? Where do you get the recording ? So it's not just for us , it's for the experiment as a whole , so New ideas found , so one or two . Kinetic powered remote control . Um , Voice um recognition thing . uh are the costs within budget , Uh , don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting . Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I don't know . Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but"
87,"Speaker A: Uh 'kay. So Yep. Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product, 'kay? And here's the agenda for this meeting. Uh I'm just gonna open, say a few boring words to start with again, and start taking minutes afterwards. You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there. Looks cool. And then we're gonna evaluate it. Then we're gonna talk about finance, and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this. And uh yep. And we're gonna evaluate the product and close. Got forty minutes to do this in. We should be fine. Let's try and keep this one on schedule. So Your thing is in where is it? Is it in Who wants it? Zapping your favourite channels, eh? Oh okay okay. Ah 'kay okay, that's favourites. Ah 'kay. I like the the the the logo on there as well. It is very prominent. So this is the Okay. Ah, okay I see. It's pretty cool. Is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it? Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it. Mm. Feels good. I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well. Yeah it's kinda cool. You have to reach a little bit don't you. Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense. It's cool. I'm impressed. And hold it so wh what's the marketing perspective? Okay. Mm it's impressing. So let me get it, if I press this button I see. That's pretty cool. Hang on. I plan to do that as well. So the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in? Ah okay okay. Yeah it's the right shape isn't it? But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling, 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides. Okay. But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that, hasn't it? So is that the the final colour scheme as well or? Okay. The hmm. It came off. The scroll wheels, a problem with them not being sort of I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore. Mm. Okay enough of that. Well i it's cool guys. 'Kay so are we done with the this presentation? Okay. Now now. Have you? Okay. Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now? Oh I see I see. Do you would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could, but lowering our profit margins? Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway, aren't we? Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that. Hmm. Yeah, the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well, or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons, you know what they do, it's very simple, and it just works. Mm there's a risk of that. Okay so we can talk about finance now. So I have a little spreadsheet for us where I I was wondering, you when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros, I was wondering how you came up with that figure? Okay so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this. Now I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros, equivalent to solar cells, which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already. Uh and I'm assuming that the locator beacon, the you know the Can be made for it sounded different that time uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display, uh an uh Uh do you think that's fair coming from a m the manufacturing?. Okay. Yep. Okay. So we're down to sixteen point four, yeah. Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved? We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur You think? Okay I'm convinced. But we save one Euro that way, yeah? So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four. Well hang on. Do don't speak so it's in here, in that w do we have any we have special form don't we? So that's yeah. But the the the we haven't talked about any special colour though uh I don't th if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're O okay so we're Push-button, scroll wheel, we're basically we have uh th is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll? Just a scroll? It's not one of the scrolls where, for example, with this one you could push it down to be a button? Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros. It wasn't bad. Okay so we're on to the We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation, where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us, and we can use that to tell How's it going? Anyone got any thoughts? How how have we done today? I think we did pretty well too. That looks pretty spectacular. Any other chang uh thoughts? Okay so th th what about um room for creativity? Is it the. I I think we we ended up being quite creative there. Mm. Not every idea necessarily, it's still a remote control. Uh no yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess, but the uh 'Kay leadership, what do we report back to the bosses? No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing. I agree. Synergy. Teamwork, yeah he is uh. What did we think of the meeting room, I guess is an important thing here. Mm. Yeah, this falls off and uh the white board worked really well without any pro Mm-mm, lapel. Wha okay, oh, alright. That's it's down, it's quite close. Keep it, keep it calm. Oh dear. No more pizza for me. So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works. Nah, I'm I'm not convinced of that at all. I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day, but see these look like they're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around, but it feels more comfortable, wh what you call upside-down. I don't care. Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid. What new ideas have we found? Well let's do both then. Uh for the product? Yeah we came up with quite a bit. And for the meeting room, Has anyone got any more Yeah less sore on the ears. Okay so Are the costs within the budget? Nope. Oh hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros. No requirements are changed. We're still under twenty Euros to build, so we're good. And the costs within the budget? Not the original budget, but they are now. Is the project evaluated? Mm I think so yeah, then celebration as it says. Oh I don't know how that got there. Uh anyway. Thank Thanks guys. Yeah, I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too. Oh.
Speaker B: So you forgot how this works again? Boss. Hmm you knocked it up? Thi third third third. The end product thingy. Yeah.. Um yeah so what we ended up with. Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department, which is us, is uh fifteen point eight Euros, someone forgot the units there yeah, uh unit price unit production price cost thing. Um we implemented the basic functions, which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator, which was one of the marketing things, cradle, scroll wheel for uh the the channels, and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping, your favourite channels functionality, in the scroll. Yeah. Zapping you know zapping. Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing. And um yeah that was the result. Start s the the start uh to to to programme yeah. Not helping. Don't have no one to handle that. Yeah. So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote. The locator function. Wicked isn't it? Ja. Nah. It fell off. W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff, but We we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works. But uh Very co very colf colourful. beep beep beep. Yeah. We don't It's a scroll. Yes. We're wicked. Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. That was mm-hmm Yeah. No. Yeah. Basically. It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was Teamwork. Yeah. And that's D you must have very long shirts. That's way far down lapel mic. Lapel lapel lapel. That's almost a crotch mi cr Oh dear oh dear. 'Cause this is you were using it o upside down. Still that Use them like that. Bunch of new ideas. Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice. Mm. Coulda been worse. Mm n no. Hooray. Free coke provided at the cafeteria. Who wrote that one? Cool.
Speaker C: So so so. Maybe. Maybe maybe maybe. Bra Mm that's oh that's oh I like it. I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for, so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this. Yeah I think it's good. Good good good job. Uh pla I'm ha It's great. That's great. It's a great feature. So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town Uh, I can see that. Yep I like. Good job. No no. Well I mean of course, I mean My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions. You know some blend of silvers and blacks. So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board. Yeah yeah. So No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it. I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint, and I think I've got this really strange cable. So what I had, basically going from the PowerPoint format, is that uh yeah yeah I like this a lot. Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room? So what we had is we had the method. That's not how you spell method, is it? No A_.. So this doesn't go so fast this way. And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh. And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market. We've got the features, we have the uh characteristics, and we have the I I don't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the corp corporate Help me. The the corporation stands behind the product, okay. So the features I think we got the scroll, we've got the uh the locator, we've got the durability, we've got the dependability, we've got you know the features that make this a unique product. Um the characteristics I talk about, we have reliability, we have comfort, we have ergonomics, we have environmentally s sensitive. Uh and the corporation, we're talking about we're we're a new we're a new company. We're wanting to make a name for ourself. We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price. One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product, a normal use guarantee, which means that this product, for the for the life of of the life use, if it should have a technical problem, that we could re replace it at no cost? That was something I would be interested in. Um so yeah without uh going into great details, we have a we have a product, it has the features and the characteristics, and the background, I believe, to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros. We're gonna be competitive, and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche. Um w That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation, based on what our competition is, I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense. But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction. But you guys came up with a great product, and at that cost I think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together. The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only. Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this. But with all of these other features I think people c one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice. There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things, so they keep it, they don't take it back. Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable? You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone. You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after Mm-hmm, but you follow what I'm s I'm s Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything, but that's that was just an idea I had. Uh to me the only additions Yeah. Yep. But anyway that's uh Mm-hmm. We've got a we've got a curve and a droop. I don't know whether that. Ooh. No, I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept. Yeah well we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right, we raised the price of it, we've added two t new technology to it. So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. But I like I mean when I say we have we had I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it. Cohesive yeah. Yes synergistic yeah. Yeah. You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or what are we ta Oh. Well I I mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables, but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about. And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon. It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well, but I don't think that's the that's avoidable. No. Okay. So we need to close this meeting, yeah bravo. Congratulations. S I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and 'kay.
Speaker D: Put on your mic. Boss. Yep. Alright. Three, three. Pedro can have it. I like I'll help talk. Unit price. Scrolling through your favourites list. It's very prominent. So here I'll give you the so this is the cradle unit, and this is the actual remote itself. Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here, um and then the volume controls are here and here. Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten. This is the power button. Uh we have our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here? This is the teletext. The programme button, yeah the programme button. So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use. So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here, and the red area is like a rubber covering. So you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber, so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem, but if you drop it yeah. Yeah and it depends on if it's sliding, but I think it's pretty ergonomic. You can feel it. Yeah of course. Well this is clay. Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach, but I think we might scale down the final model a bit. These this is a bit larger than it would be, but Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability. Beep beep beep. Um beep beep beep so beep beep beep beep beep beep be shut up. Beep beep beep okay. Um no no no tha that's alri Exactly that's exactly what those are for. And um there's one other feature that we were debating, but we decided to go against it, is um you could beep beep beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there, but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there. And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so Mm. Right. So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit, but Mm-hmm. Oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time. So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people. Careful. Beep beep beep. Yeah. No way. Beep beep beep. Mm-hmm. Well, that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units. Oh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print, we only need the uh the regular chip on print, so there may have been a m miscalculation in there. And we and we have a single-curved uh Uh I think that It's single-curved, yeah. See it's a little bit more than f single-curved. So yeah it's fifteen point eight, that's where we came up with it. Okay. Yeah we do. Ah. What do you know. Oh it's a that's not very special, it's pretty If th. That's a scroll. Uh no we just use it as a scroll. It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say. Yeah. S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate. What? I think we did pretty well. Sh I think there was plenty of room. We got a couple innovative i Couple innovative ideas. Mm-hmm. Yep. There was a lot of synergy. These cables suck. Yep. Yeah. Lapel. That's our boss. Pedro's right. Pedro's right. Oh wel Well we had the favourites list, and the scroll bar, and we have the cradle, and the r uh remote call feature. All right. Good job guys.","Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , And here's the agenda for this meeting . Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product And then we're gonna evaluate it . Then we're gonna talk about finance , Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros , we implemented the basic functions , which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . Scrolling through your favourites list . I like the the the the logo on there as well . Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , so this is the cradle unit , This is the teletext . So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . Beep beep beep . And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board . No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . We've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this and at that cost I think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , Okay so we can talk about finance now . So I have a little spreadsheet for us I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . Uh and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display , um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? It's single-curved , So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four . See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . we haven't talked about any special colour though if is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? That's a scroll . then we have fifteen point eight Euros . We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , How how have we done today ? I think we did pretty well . No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? Sh I think there was plenty of room . I think we we ended up being quite creative there . we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was These cables suck . So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . What new ideas have we found ? Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature . Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . Are the costs within the budget ? Not the original budget , but they are now . So we need to close this meeting , Is the project evaluated ?"
125,"Speaker A: Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Yeah the universal ones. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm, it's about that. Mm. Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black. As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour? Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least. Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things? Because we always lose our remote control. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Then you lose it, yeah. Kind of um, maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah. No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ but Okay. So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said? Yep. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh no,. Sorry it's okay. Okay, cool.
Speaker B: Slim. Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market? What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices? What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market. So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player, M_P_ three player like any electronic devices. They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this. Yeah. Yep. Uh. Hmm.
Speaker C: Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros. So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah. So presumably that might be an idea to put into. Yeah, yeah. Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so? And that's quite a lot for a remote control. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. The the keyrings, yeah yeah. Okay, that's cool. Okay. Okay. 'Kay. So, we're looking for 'Kay. We're Sorry, carry on. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty. Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate. So you do the looking around at other remote controls. Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever. And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach. Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive. Uh. And you look at competition and design. Cool. So we have uh Um. Okay, groovy. And no doubt we'll get um Sorry. We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well. Okay. I shall I can't imagine these are worth much. Okay. Fashion into electronic. Okay.
Speaker D: Alright so twenty five. So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic. So uh Mm. But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features. For sure. Yeah, yeah. Right. Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this? 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily. Right. Okay. Wait for emails? Hmm.","Uh , making a profit of fifty million Euros . so twenty five . So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things Yeah the universal ones . Yeah . So presumably that might be an idea to put into .

64,"Speaker A: Uh, Dave Cochrane. User Interface Defin Designer, yes. Um Um, the monkey, um. The one f uh in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh well my I have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey. Um, monkeys have attitude. Which I think is a good thing. And I mean fr and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting. Um, so I like monkeys. And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most. Well, one thing I'm aware of is, th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models, so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs, you can programme in macros, and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of three in one, five in one, whatevers, but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control, to a much greater extent, and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel, get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound, for instance. Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design. And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket. Absolutely prohibitive, yeah. Yeah, I mean I wouldn't like to say you g I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion. Some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros. For instance, um let's say oh oh um, or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well, um Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic, something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand. But of course, uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall,. A curve, mm-hmm. Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form, uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway.
Speaker B: Tarik Rahman. T_A_R_I_K_. Industrial Designer.. Do we take them off? Oh right, okay. Ah-ha. Now where do I put the Is this supposed to be clipped as well? Uh, destroying your elephant here. Uh, here we have a tiger. Uh I've always loved tigers. They're just they're big, they're biggest cats, uh I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat, just 'cause it was looks the best, the stripes, orange. My dad used to talk about he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when I was a kid. And uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild. So uh that's why I like them. Didn't say an anything about me really but Mm. 'Kay. Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff, do you think they should have some sort of stick on it, rather than buttons? Like uh control pads, you know of games, but or is that a bit ridiculous? Yeah..
Speaker C: Okay, well I think we're ready to begin. Right, my name's Adam Duguid, we're here because of real reaction, um, we have in the group Um, yeah, go for it mate. N_ E_ Z_. Ebenezer. And your role is? You're the Marketing Expert, okay. Next we have? T_ R_ I_ K_. And your role in this is? Industrial Designer. And, lastly we have? And you're going to be the User Interface, is it? Designer. Okay. Right. This is the agenda for today's meeting. As you can see, w opening, acquaintance, tool training, project plan discussion, and closing. Um, we already got n through opening, and partially through acquaintance. So, the reason we're here, we're gonna design a new remote control, as you probably all know. The very broad overview is original, trendy, and user-friendly. Course, we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that, but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design. Um, there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway, so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart. This is how today seems to be going to work. We're gonna have the three kay phases, as you've probably already been told, the functional, architectural, and the detailed design. Um First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec, technical functions, working design. Second seems to be conceptual components, properties, materials, and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far. Of course, you've all got the similar emails, I believe, right. What can I say? Ebenezer, you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal? Brilliantly done. Thank you. Tarik, would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry? Oh, um, you can clip them to your belt. You should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well. Yep, the, it's just across there, that's it. Yep. Yeah. It'll follow you if you You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now, I wouldn't worry too much. Should have good range. Excellent, thank you very much. Dave, if you'd like to uh have a dash. Cheers. Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now. Also not quite as feared as your average tiger, but uh cats are one of my favourite animals, they're very independent, they're snotty as hell at the best of times, and uh, what can you say, you got to love those qualities in an animal. Right. I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it, so, on to it. Project finance. As you can see, twelve point five Euros per unit. That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware, and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five. If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them. Yep. Well, fifty million, and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one, then, awful lot need to be sold. Okay. Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project. So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls. Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market? Okay. Okay, yeah, tha that's true, with the price range we're looking at, going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our yeah. But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion. Would the the idea something along the lines of, one on button would turn on say the video recorder, the T_V_, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go, is that kind of Okay, that sounds like a a good strong idea. Um Any takes on this? Okay. Okay. Yeah I've heard I've seen the bar-code design before, yeah. Okay, well we're beginning to run out of time now, so, we've got a couple of ideas, we can we'll have to work fast, um, alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting, so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality, um, how the user interface might work, that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it, you have to have a lot of response back, or at least some kind. Um And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out what the user wants, yes. Um, right. Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage, anything they think that might have been missed so far? I I don't see why not, almost everybody is probably used to a console by now, and all of them incorporate small keypads on them, in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well, so it's probably an interface that most people are used to. Um and that could allow n easy navigation, used as a joystick as well. Okay. So, small, stylish, and something that's just a little different. Okay. That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily. I would I would have hoped so anyway. Um, right. I'd say we finish this one up, we get started, I'll get in, I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done, and I'll get that out to everybody. Yeah? Okay. Um, as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here, um unless we get told otherwise, and just take the laptops with us.
Speaker D: Oh, Ebenezer Ademesoye. Would you like me to spell that? S Um, N_E_Z_ E_R_. I'm the Marketing Expert. Sure. Whiteboard. 'Kay. S okay. I will make this quick, since we don't have much time. Um. 'Kay, so it's not the best picture in the world. Here we have an elephant. First point, begins with an E_, same like Ebenezer. Also, elephants have a very good memory, much like myself, and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria, but I think I used to have a pet elephant. So elephants are big, strong and gentle, and they have great memories, and they begin with the letter E_, just like Ebenezer. Thank you. Oh. Oh oh I think you ga The little The the Oh that's good, we can clip them on. Okay. Yeah, there was this microphone as well that you Just um somewhere I think so. Yeah. There you go. Oh, that was profiting, that was an amount, so that's the amount made, okay. Yeah. Oh. 'Kay Well um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television, um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable, using the cable subscribed the cable providers, but our remote controls would get worn out really easily, and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar, um keypad, for playing games. So perhaps one that was more um specialised for game playing or interactive television. They they've recently brought out this new remote control, for people to set their favourite channels, or um to record things. Instead of people entering in what time things start, you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins, and slide another bar to say what time it ends, you know that's Yeah, it's it's taken out the Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control. I think for gaming, you know you want you want some big buttons for up, down, left and right, shoot. Uh, you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television, so you need buttons to change the television angle, the camera angles and stuff like that. Yeah. What the user wants uh. Okay. Oh. Okay,. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. So..","The team members introduced themselves to each other by name and by their roles in the project. The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed why they liked the animal. The project manager discussed the project finances and selling prices. The team then discussed various features to consider in producing the remote such as gaming options, an LCD screen, and combining functionality so as to control multiple devices."
102,"Speaker A: Okay. Well, let's start. What are we doing? Oops. Okay. Okay. Not doing. Uh Very good. Okay. we have presentations. So first, it's your turn. Yeah. Isn't it amazing. Industrial Designer. Interface concept. Can you go back one page? For the uh menu, what do we use for that? We don't have buttons for the menu. Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel. Okay. But uh You have to put it on the Yeah. Yeah but, has to be clear that you can use the arrows. Mm-hmm. Yes. The second one. Okay. Not too much colours. No, it's not flower power. S okay. Okay. Thank you. So, you're next. Hmm. No, isn't. But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons. Then you can scroll, you see what number, and then you push. But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel. If you don't Hmm, yes. But then. Yeah, then you go one down one up. When you scroll. Yeah but like we said before, it has to be used on every television. So you may not be uh No. The television must do that. So Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room. And mostly they are smaller. So Most the times that are not advanced televisions. Okay. That's important. Yeah. Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_. It's very important. Yeah, more expensive. But how much? Oh. Okay. Okay. Well, thank you. Next. No. It's clear. So now, it's uh Ah, let's see. Now, w we have to decide Well, we have to decide on the concept. So, we have to look at 'S next. Components and user interface concept. So Now, we have to make some concept. Maybe one of you can paint it on the board. First, uh user interface. Yes, a concept on uh Just Yeah, but maybe we can paint it. Uh, what do we want? I'll paint. Okay. Well Something like this? Or Shapes or What do we need? Yes, okay. Okay. And you have to. Yeah. So, it has to be soft? Okay. And uh, the buttons? Buttons. No, it won't. But, well there one for the sound and one for the channels. Uh, two scroll uh wheels. That's th that's more difficult. It's better in But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu. Yeah, but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it? You don't know. So, there's no menu. No. So you can't use it. Okay, we make two concepts. One with L_C_D_. One without L_C_D_. Good concept. But That's one. It's one. Two. Number two. No. But when you handle it, you put it on and off. It's not good to use. Yeah, but I'll zap. Fuck. Out. No, it's not good. Now, second concept. One with L_C_D_, one without L_C_D_. Then uh Paint it. One with two scroll buttons and one with without. Yeah. Uh, one with a with a menu, and one without a menu. And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_. Unbelievable. Do I have to do everything. Blank. You have Not so difficult. Uh, that's the menu. There for the L_C_D_ screen. You have to For the menu. Mm-hmm. One that way. And one that way. So Then it depends on the cost. S On and off. When it's not too big. Just like a a phone. Yes, okay. Very good. Is it better? When you uh the menu, you have to go there there there there. Yeah, okay. That's that's the outside. But now the First the buttons. Sorry? Mute. And the other. Yeah. Not so difficult. But how do you wanna solve it? Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy. Then you go down, you switch, you go into the right, you switch, you go down. Yeah. A joystick. Yeah. But is it uh Does that break, a joystick? Or a small one just like in a laptop. Mean, it's better. But how expensive it is? Oh. Why do I pay you for? Um, well um Better ideas. For the young peoples I think scroll button's good. So Think we have to keep them. Yeah, but is it That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better. A small one. No just like in a a laptop. Small, round. Then it's not so big. Oh the sh Yeah, but then you can You have to use t with one hand. So Maybe, if it's possible, it's not too expensive, I think a joystick is better. A small one. So, please look at it. Yeah we I think you get it. So, after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it. Yes. Your problem. Not mine. Okay. So, do we have other concepts? Then for the components, we use a normal battery. Then it's Ch cheapest way, I think. No, no kinetic. Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive. So we use a normal battery. Chip. Depends on the L_C_D_. Scroll. Yeah. And uh, we If you use the L_C_D_, we have to Yes, okay. So, depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll. Okay. Okay. So, uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and But, it has to be small. I think. If you have pistol, it L_C_D_'s not easy. Y y Yeah but If you use a phone. k Yeah, but but then you have it. Like, th if you have pistol, you have it so. And the screen is Well, then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen. Yeah. No. No, no. Yeah, but then you look forward. And then you can y N well, if you have to look at it. Then it goes like this. If th n well Yes, of course. That's good good. But the um, it may not break. Okay. If that's possible. Okay. Yeah of course. Okay. Then this is the design. And the buttons are on the next page. So, depends on the cost. So, um we have one minute. I think. No. More. Seven. Next meeting. Thirty minutes. So hurry up. You two stay here. Paint it. Now you have to. So I think it's clear. Check your mail. So It has to be ready in the next meeting. So Next meeting is called the detailed design. So Everyth everything has to be ready. Thanks for your attention.
Speaker B: Ah, pinball. Huh. Uh, maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation. And you will see it. I'm next, okay. Yes. No. Here we go. Uh, at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want, our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to. And then, I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs, about uh what battery is in it, what kind of buttons also. First uh, the younger people, they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours. Like, totally yellow, totally red. Uh, so it's visible. Uh, the shapes are curved and round, like uh you also said. Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones, straight and uh flat and long. But to give him the shape of your hand, so you it's easier to use or something like that. But that's just an idea. And then, I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control. The battery, there are few options. Uh, I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery. So, everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket. Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch. When you uh shake it a few times, it it's loaded. Uh, the the form of the remote control, I think it's also nice have it curved. And maybe like it's hand-shaped. Uh, so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons. Uh material, you use plastic. Hard plastic uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time. And also rubber because the younger people like that, what we see in the research. Uh the push-buttons. We have one new thing uh discovered. It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse. Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels. When you want to go m move up, you just scroll up and click on the button, if you wanna see the next, uh if you wanna see that channel. And also for the mouse, uh for the volume, it's also uh easy to use. Just scroll a bit up, scroll a bit down. And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this, and you get it here. You can do it with your thumb. And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one, you can see channel one. The electrics um with a scroll push uh button, we must use regular uh chips. There are also uh simple chips. They are uh cheaper. Um, but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control, and I think there are a lot of those uh things, and people won't buy it any more. They have seen enough of it. And you have also advanced um chips. But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen. And the costs will increase a lot more. And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_, and the chip who is more expensive. And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control, that we then use the primary colours. Like, you get a yellow uh remote control, red one, blue one, et cetera. You have any more questions about this? I think the main thing is we look at the costs. And not too basic, not a basic remote control, who everybody already has. Not with an L_C_D_. No. Yeah. But then, what I say, the costs will uh get a lot higher. Th then you'll see it on the television. Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television, it's like you see uh one to twenty, you go uh uh s scroll up, and push number tw twenty. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think the younger people will have newer televisions, which can provide our uh remote control. Yes. But that won't be a problem. I think. No, but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls. And I think, what I said, everybody has them uh has them already. And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros. Uh, and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing. And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news. I got it on my screen and it was uh higher. But I don't know uh how much higher. That's true. But then we'll I think we must discuss who uh what will be better. If we have a better shape of the um remote control, or better options on it. With a scroll menu, a w scroll thing, and a L_C_D_. And then a flat um remote control. Or, a more hand-shaped remote control, with scroll, without L_C_D_. I can uh look on my uh Uh Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip. A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip, which is a higher price range. The display requires a advanced chip, which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip. Doesn't say. That's from my manufacturing division. Yes? Changing covers. Nope. Uh, uh-uh. How w how we how we make it? Uh Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all Yeah, but if I paint with More like something M like Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it. Uh I have to. I'm not a designer. It's more three D_. Like, um when you have a part here. This is the remote control. And then you have something like th this under it. So, it's easier to get it like this. It's like a gun. And it has to be soft, yeah. So, you can squeeze in it and Sorry? Buttons on top of it. And here. The scrolling. You can do it with your thumb. But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here. One till uh uh zero till nine. And the b Yeah? Or two buttons. If uh 'Kay c If we do If we use one, then we'll have just a switch on it, and you'll just switch it, and now it's the sound to switch back with the menu uh button. And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it. Just not like all the other ones, with uh this thing, and uh here an arrow, here an arrow, here an arrow, here an arrow. Because uh, from h hundred uh remote controls, ninety nine have it. Uh, then we have it on the T_V_, the menu. I don't know. It's like some sort of uh teletext option, but we don't have teletext. And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it, then the costs will uh be much higher. 'Kay. But you all like this kind of thing. Uh With the scroll button. And and this one has to be soft. And this has to be harder, because when it falls, it mu mu must not burst. Or some kind of rubber around it. Yeah. Yeah. Ah that's nice. Here. Trigger. Paint it? With the scroll thing on, like this? So? Draw it. But is it easy to use? When you have it on your left side, and Separate, more separate, h yeah. Yeah. On the left a scroll button, and on the right a scroll button. But would it be easy to use then? If it's like you have a big uh I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for. They were like round curves, uh different uh Okay, okay, okay. Mm-hmm. Personally, I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle. With the switch button. No like uh Oh, you mean like that. Uh, then you can also have like uh th um Yeah, and joystick, I think. Yeah like in a laptop, s uh s some sort of thing. A little bit bigger, with easier thi I don't know. Or no scroll uh things. Just a shape. And No, no. It won't work. Yeah. Uh-huh. Or a remote control more like joystick. A small one like this, like a Nintendo uh k Playstation thing. No, no, no. I mean the the shape of the remote control. Just like a Playstation thing. Yeah. No, that's okay, I got Uh they're not uh in details. It's more expensive or less expensive, huh? Then I have to come with it. I got my personal costs. I I don't I don't know the costs. Then I'll uh make something up. Yeah, or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery. Yeah, I think it's uh, yeah, more expensive. Yeah. Okay. Depends on the scroll. If we use a scroll, then we have the uh regular chip. If we don't use a scroll, then we can use the simple chip. And that's Uh the most expensive. Yeah. If we Yeah. If we No okay scroll-wheel. So, I have this. So, it will be uh the advanced chip, or the uh regu uh or the regular chip. Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it? Just use your thumb. If you Yeah. I use my thumb. Yeah. If you have a joystick on No, if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller. And you move up, f forward, down, left. Then you have uh just, yeah, a little bit curved. It's not just uh straight. That's how we use it. That's why they make joysticks like that, I think. Yeah? 'Kay. Here's our designer. Yeah. Yeah, why not. It's for the younger people. It's something new. Now we put uh rubber around it. Hard plastic, uh the shape, and around it hard uh around it rubber. And the uh the hand shape is also rubber. Huh. This is something new. Costs are okay. Oh, that's us together. Yes. 'Kay. Bye bye.
Speaker C: Mm. Ah. Hey. Ah. Now I have my screen back too. Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting. Large. A lot a lot of buttons buttons. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yep. Yeah. But, thi i uh This is with an L_C_D_? No, not. Uh, can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without? 'Cause it I think if we have an L_C_D_, it will also sell a lot better. And that might uh bring back the costs uh Huh. 'Kay. My turn? Mm. So So Yeah. So, my uh presentation is about trend-watching. Uh, I did some trend-watching. It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends. 'Cause if you don't, you won't sell. So, well how we did do that? Uh, well we made an investigation of the market, by Trendwatchers. They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan. Of course, well known for their uh trend uh trends. And well, uh what did you find? Uh, we have two groups, young and trendy, and the old and rich. Well th and the young and trendy, they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes, shoes, and also uh products. And um, material? That should feel have uh a spongy feeling. And to get a feeling for what it is, uh here is an image of it. Then the old and rich. They like uh dark colours, and simple, recognisable shapes. And um, they also like uh familiar material, uh especially wood. Now, another picture. To get a feeling for this. Well, uh then already come to my personal preferences. We uh aim at the younger market. So, we should also be uh look at their uh trends. However, with trends it's always if there's it's now. It it it might last one year, and next year it be uh can be totally different. And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year. So, we m must not just only look at what the trend is now, as it might be totally different next year. So, that's uh one thing to keep in mind. Yeah. Any questions? Yeah. Mm. Can make several uh concepts. We have this, and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand. Yeah I I I uh yes. Yeah. A g Mm.. Yeah. And i if we go to uh But if we have uh a me Yeah. If we have a menu, uh how do we uh choose other options? Yeah. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Yeah. Yeah. M uh yeah, maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um more separate, yeah. Like, you have the menu button in between uh Yeah. Think we have we have now two buttons missing. The uh um The mute button. We have two buttons missing. The mute button. And um, the to to uh have to uh numbers Okay. But, uh Okay. And on the L_C_D_, how much it costs? Uh, it costs extra? Yeah. Yes. Uh Uh, yeah, but Yeah. If you If we have uh then something standing here, with the L_C_D_. Um, Yeah. I can't see the. But, uh the easy of uh, th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it. Uh, for us it's about to sell it. Uh One. No. You have more. You have still ten. Yeah. What? Okay. Okay. See you at the next meeting.
Speaker D: Hmm. Oh. Mine. Oh, great. Uh Yes, well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept. Uh, first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose, uh show you some samples, uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe, already. And uh my personal preferences. Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off. The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off. The channels buttons, one to nine, and uh off uh uh zero to nine, and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine. Uh the volume and channel quadrants, uh left and right, up and down arrows, to uh do the volume and channel. And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display. Um, I found some uh interesting uh uh samples. Examples. Um, well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh Yeah. Yeah. Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long. Um, power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right. Um, well we see the the the same uh arrows. Like there. And uh Yeah, well arrow b buttons can be blue. And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons. Some buttons have icons like the play and stop, but we don't use that. But uh, these we we have to choose the right icons, or or letters. Uh this is the V_ for volume, but they're both uh a V_. So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that. Um Yeah. So, that's Uh, well Yeah. I thought that was our uh idea. So, uh how Like this. Or or this. And that the menu button is okay. Yeah, okay. Uh, so the The icons on the arrows, as well, you mean. Yeah. Uh, well that's something to uh think about. Okay. Um, well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already, or in the next uh meeting. But uh, as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo, I would uh recommend a yellow case. Uh, round edges. The logo at the bottom. And uh, well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour. So, it's good. Uh, recognisable. K so, I think. Uh, no. Not too much. But uh No, no, no. But this has to be has to be trendy and uh and Uh, yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons, and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion. That was that. Hmm. No. Mm, yes. What? Mm. Yeah. But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then? Yeah, okay. But but how Yeah. How Okay. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger. Like uh Just to uh Oh, like a Yeah. But if you put push the the menu button Yeah, wh what Yes, but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm, yeah. Yeah. It's uh Or you can uh turn it inside. But that's No, that's true.. Okay. Cookie.","let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples . Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh Large . A lot a lot of buttons buttons . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ . So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that . For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? We don't have buttons for the menu . Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel . I thought that was our uh idea . And that the menu button is okay . Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . Uh , recognisable . Not too much colours . Uh , no . Not too much . But this has to be has to be trendy Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you it's easier to use or something like that . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice have it curved . And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic And also rubber Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . You can do it with your thumb . And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . And that might uh bring back the costs uh I think we must discuss who uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ . Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . Not with an L_C_D_ . But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? But I don't know uh how much higher . I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . And um , material ? That should feel have uh a spongy feeling . Then the old and rich . They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . We uh aim at the younger market . Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . However , with trends it's always if there's it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be uh can be totally different . Well , we have to decide on the concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . Can make several uh concepts . We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand . This is the remote control . And then you have something like th this under it . So , it has to be soft ? And it has to be soft , yeah . Buttons on top of it . The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb . But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ? with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu . Yeah , but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . we make two concepts . One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ . And and this one has to be soft . And this has to be harder , And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . It's not good to use . Or some kind of rubber around it . One with two scroll buttons and one with without . Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ . Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . Then it depends on the cost . M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um more separate , yeah . Like , you have the menu button in between uh I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . When you uh the menu , you have to go there there there there . We have two buttons missing . The mute button . Mute . And the other . Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle . With the switch button . But how do you wanna solve it ? Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy . Uh , then you can also have like uh th um Yeah , and joystick , I think . Or a small one just like in a laptop . Does that break , a joystick ? But how expensive it is ? For the young peoples I think scroll button's good . That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better . I mean the the shape of the remote control . Just like a Playstation thing . Maybe , if it's possible , it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . Then for the components , we use a normal battery . Then it's Ch cheapest way , I think . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ . If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . And uh , we If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to Uh the most expensive . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? If you have pistol , it L_C_D_'s not easy . if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . Now we put uh rubber around it . Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . Next meeting . Thirty minutes . You two stay here . Check your mail . It has to be ready in the next meeting . Next meeting is called the detailed design . And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? they're not uh in details . It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it ."
55,"Speaker A: Oh God. Uh, no that's okay, sorry. Um is it okay if I postpone that til later, I just want to get access to a little bit more information, is that okay? Mm-hmm. Could I can I interject to ask a question there, is that appropriate? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it? Mm-hmm. Right, the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not, right? Oh I see. Okay. Mm. Mm. Mm. That's a very important part, it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that, whenever you like me to present. No. The plug hasn't come out at the bottom, has it? No. Meter adjusting. Mm. 'Kay. Have I got to keep this here? Does it matter? I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I? Uh, whoops. Will it manage? Bit more, oh dear. Oh. Is that okay? Thank you, just pull it closer a little bit. Get it right over, okay, thank you. Okay, um, I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research. Um, so that's where we started, we used our our usability lab, the company's usability lab, we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public, male and female, all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab, just their general use of the remote control, you can see we had a hundred subjects there. Our findings, lots of findings, I've just summarised some of them here. The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls, so it has obvious design implications there. Um, we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy, we were quite surprised by that finding, but um that's quite a high proportion of our our, you know, international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking. Um, current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall. For example, you can see below there, seventy five percent of users zap a lot, so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping. So again there's power implications there. Um, fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons, so again a big design issue there. Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier, uh remote controls are often lost in the room, it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing, uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that. Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons, they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions. Um, um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury. You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems. Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition, again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition. Something we didn't put to them, but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light, possibly. Um, that trend reverses in the older age groups. So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features, that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses, they're not so bothered with this. I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you, but I think I'll just keep it simple, if there's any more information I can email you extra details, is that okay? Mm-hmm, so can we not programme a video with this remote control? Just channel-hopping. Would that imply video use? Mm-hmm, yes. Yes. Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons, I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video, fast-forwarding, so on and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare. So I don't know if that's something we need to look at. Mm-hmm. In fact I've just called up that table there, we asked those two questions, the table relates to both questions, so we didn't differentiate. Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen, that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control? So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there, and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group, I think that's just general fear of new technology. Oh yeah. Right. Mm. Yes. That's a super idea. Yeah. Yes, further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is, it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market. What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African, I dunno, you get the idea. It's it's gonna vary around the world. At the end of the day, th the engineering design is one thing, it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same, yes, absolutely. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm concerned, when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again, repetitive strain injury, I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough, I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that. Um, R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements. I'm j I really can't get my head round this one, this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about. Mm. I know, and it becomes ridiculous, yes I know. Yeah. Yes. Mm-hmm. Do we have to initially um, you know looking at the findings here, focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later. Do we really have to go for everyone right away? Um. Mm. And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people, young people, trendy people. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too, for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage, we want to, you know, not waste money, not be profligate and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up, first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this. Mm. Right, I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful. Ah, hmm. Right. Superb. Mm. Yes. Right. Excellent, mm-hmm. Mm. Right. Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me, I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another, but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me, to produce our own mobile phones, that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features, um, chain companies like Carphone Warehouse, you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it, they'll phone the company, you can use their telephones. Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this, if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, th you know, which button is it I press for this? Th as free as a free aspect of our service, would that not make it more attractive to them? Mm. Mm-hmm. Right. Alright. Yes If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel, but I mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video, we're not gonna put any okay, just a thought. Okay. Mm-hmm. Sure. Mm. Yeah. Not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that, yes okay. Mm. Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious, yes. Sure, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical, these long, brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface. We definitely an ob an obvious thing, a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles, we don't want that. Mm-hmm. Slightly curved, curved. Mm. Mm. I mean look at the mobile. I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea, I've not come across anything like that before, if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip-top. Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic, nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers, that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think. I think it's a really nice idea and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic, you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic, we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Less chance of it being lost too, it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either. It's easier to bit nice to handle. Mm-hmm. Okay. Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything. So it's no teletext, it's only for T_V_ and by implication video, our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control, um something about Videoplus. Right. Right. Right, so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_, a reminder about using Videoplus? So that they have a look at the guide and Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements, is this just that was an add-on feature? Uh-huh. Right. Right, so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature? Right. Mm, and the rechargeable batteries. Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements? Mm-hmm. That's not at the moment a requirement, it's something we're looking at, what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like. Okay. What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting? Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved? Okay. Okay. Whoops, questionnaire four. 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think.
Speaker B: Help. It's up there? That screen's black. Alright, okay. Okay, that's fine. Are we done? Right, okay um, this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place. Um, right our agenda for today, do you want us to give you a second? Okay, um I'll go over what we decided last meeting, um, we decided upon a universal control, one handset for all, T_V_, video equipment. Um, that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limiting anyone. We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product, we put fashion in electronics, you know that kind of s thing. Um, our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget, um that we might have a bit of oh oh you can see it, okay. Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like. Um want it to look uncluttered, undaunting to the customer. We discussed a flip-open design, um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming, things like that. Okay. Um, three presentations, I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first? No that's fine, that's fine. Unplug me. Um, F_N_ function F_ eight. Mm-hmm. They are. Okay, thank you very much. Um, would you like to continue on from that? Or, maybe move the laptop over. F_ function. Oh, there. 'Kay. Um, I think we'll chat about it at the end, okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end, um Ooh, it's vibrating, that's strange. Oh, God. Right, okay. We just do the best we can. Yeah, you might. Ah. Look at that. Okay. Yeah. Right, um we have new project requirements, um we're not going to be using teletext, um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now. Um our control is only going to be for T_V_, it's not going to be a combined control, which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us, but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer. It says for T_V_ only, so looks like it's just yeah, I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it, but I don't know, what do you think? It just said, for T_V_ only. But I mean, general T_V_ controls do do video as well. I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you? Mm. I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming. Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, bu We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves, so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing um because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose, you were saying whistling, maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote, you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps and you're like oh okay it's over there, something like that, but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me. Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset. Um so we want logo, we want um fashionable, trendy, I mean what you were talking about with the marketing. Um, people paying more for it to look good. Um, we need to focus on that as well. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What about you were talking about the buttons, um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big, rubber buttons, not tiny little one, big, rubber buttons, but what about, I mean, 'cause we got to make it original, what about um you know with the touch screen computers yeah? Um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either, not sure about the You don't have to press it, you just have to put your thumb onto it. Um, think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan, I'm thinking uh young, um office people, trendy kind of a thing. Um, but quite, um, easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations, um Were too big. Mm. I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller, or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly, um. It's gonna be the same, so we need to focus on just one thing, not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities, um. Or a speech recognition, which is extremely expensive, I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue. We are we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well. That they want um it to be fashionable, they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations. Now with the baby boomers, the older generations are actually larger, they have a greater population than us young people, but I don't think we're focusing on that, I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um, business kind of class type people. Mm-hmm. Okay, so the remote control functions. Um we've got the T_V_, we've got the video, now there's um I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of programme details, yes. We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that, is that I always found that really easy when I discovered it, um because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on, that's fine, but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to, you put the number in and it's just a number, it's not a date, it's not a time, it's not a channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not anything like that, it's just a number. No. You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway. It is after um if you look in the newspaper, T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five, six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times, um and it has been around for quite a long time. No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that Mm. Okay so Mm-hmm. The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it. Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing, it's not working, what should I do? I think so. Um Instruction manuals. But I mean they're there's customer service, there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge, there's no extra, t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street, um. Mm. But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages. It does, you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it, so that should be something we think about. Um, what other functions? We need I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now, but we should think about c 'cause you've got the dilemma between oh batteries, that's what I was thinking about. Mobile phone batteries, what kinda battery is that? Well they la they they last quite a long time, and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones, you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something, but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged. Um, something like that should reduce the size of it. Yeah it could be on that yeah, okay. S Yes. Rechargeable with a docking station. So the rechargeable which would be your field. Okay. Yes, which it is cheaper in the long run as well. Um, th the shape you got trendy. I don't wanna big box with lots of things, you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either, because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple, um They do. Okay so we've got a flip-screen. Um Okay. 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway. Okay. Can you look into the company logo? Um, things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product. I mean for example, if it was a C_ or something like that, you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell, or something, um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design, while also making it quite different from anything else that's there. Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different. Or you could do um different, like you get with mobile phones, different fascias. You could have different kind of casings. So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and Yeah. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right, I think we have to round it up, um Sure. That was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions, making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel, things like that. Um it could be it c It yes, it could be uh adv advertisement feature, um rather than design feature, you know, drawing attention to that. And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual, 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful. Yeah. Um We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it, um. Yes. Yes. And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something, a beeping for being lost, um. Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible. But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the I the instruction manual, I don't know if we deal with that, um. I think Yep, and different from what's out there. Yep, I think that's us. I think you might get guidance, but um I th Instruction manuals, 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing, u um, they're everyone's got like a big pile of them, but no one really uses them. Um. Yes, right. Okay. Right, okay. I think you can email me, if there's any more questions. Um and I'll be able to not answer them.
Speaker C: Okay, yeah I'll go first. Can I grab the Thanks. What do I have to press? Oh, F_ eight? Oh right, yeah. Okay. Maybe Yep there we go. Okay this is uh the working design, presented by me, the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire. 'Kay, this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so. What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design? Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state, whether that be the power, or the channel um or the volume, everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to. Um, so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that. But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside really. So um, yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one. Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use, wireless and, you don't need to send very much information. Um, most of them are powered by some form of battery. Now our one, I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control. Yeah sure. Um no no, if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries, they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in. Yeah the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across. Um, and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round. Um, now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller. Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work, uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose, we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller and to turn it into an i uh infrared signal which we're going to use to send the information. Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema, which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine. And then I was uh just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer. And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do. It's not a proper circuit, I'm not sure if it'd work or not, I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway, we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um which would basically, when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver, which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment. And then finally, um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good. Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base, we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about, uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have, I th that was just sort of a general point there. And that's uh yeah. Alright okay, and yeah, that's that's what I came up with there, so if you wanna Ooh. Function F_ eight yeah. No, no yeah it's just. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah sure. There we go, I've got a bit more of the cable. There we go. Uh you should be able to and yeah, there you go. Okay. Huh. T yeah yeah. I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g Yeah. If yeah and if you got if you got a Sky box, they have one of those plus boxes, you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so. Yeah. Yeah. Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great anyway. Alright, okay. Alright, okay. Yeah. Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so I thought that could be quite a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same. Just yeah, yeah. 'Kay. Yeah, yeah that's what I was just yeah. No, well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just Yeah. Yeah. Mm. But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs, ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big because um they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh so if you I don't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes yeah. Yeah, speech recognition, but yeah. Mm. Ge uh Yeah. Video plus. Yeah yeah. Just whack in the number. And you w yeah. And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that, you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway, yeah. It's not Yeah. It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things. Mm. Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series. So that yeah. But just to have that function would be would be really good. Yeah. Mm. But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out and also I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having Yeah, I mean I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that. Yeah. Department, yeah. Yeah. And they're yeah, they should be f yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's the uh yeah. Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones, but they come with a charger, I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh Yeah on that as well so. Yeah some sort of docking station or yeah. Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine, and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Speaker D: Mm-hmm. Sorry. Yep. Okay. Yep. 'Kay. It can be okay, that's okay with me. further. Oops. Why's it not working? F_ eight, right? Okay. Mm why's it in the right? Yeah, it's connecting. okay. Yeah. Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention, but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting, just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um, I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable. So purpose, as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible. And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use, rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever. But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it, will this two features together. So what the concept is to have a flip-top model. The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever, can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top. So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people. Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user. As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said? Yeah, with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also, so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly. Um, that's so this is if you ask me personally, I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that. So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design. Uh any comments like, if you want? Okay. I think you'll have to You can't It'll have to this can't be pulled. You'll have to push it a bit more. Yep. Yeah this is more than enough. Okay. Yeah I think you can pull it out now. Yeah. 'Kay. That's fine. Okay. Mm-hmm. Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that? Ten perc Mm-hmm. Okay. Pens Mm-hmm. Okay. So are we talking of a single model or maybe five, six designs? Sure. Alright. Right. The features could be same and the body could look slightly different. So Yeah. Yeah, uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use, the injuries, maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that. So, a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups, you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also, the market. Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small, yeah. Mm-hmm. We could focus on the biggest market. If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street, but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that. Simple. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote? Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay. What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back. Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box, like a chocolate. That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up, so they came up with something like this, curled up, so here, and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much, so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing, curled up like a boat. G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like. So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom, something like that. I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth. Current. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We could look in at that but Mm. What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells, logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model, rather than you know, trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like. A sea shell? Yeah we could look in at that. Yeah maybe we could come at some say five, six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like, that could be the most common design. But we can like think of five, six designs. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. For detection, right. Yep, I think True. Oops. We should f I think it's time for us to get back to","The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote. He presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design. The User Interface Designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface. The Marketing Expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device, and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology. The Project Manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function, that it be used only to control television, and that it include the company image in its design. The group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market. They discussed the functions the remote will have, including Video Plus capability and rechargeable batteries. A customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly, but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget. The group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers."
108,"Speaker A: Is that someone's? Okay. Or something. Well done. Certainly. Logged in? Thank you. Oops. Okay. This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research. So this is the first stage of the evaluation. Now, the collection of the criteria, as we saw in our previous meeting, was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company. So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting, are we actually meeting those trends and requirements? Now the findings that we came up with, just a recap, are here. The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, it should be easy to use, it should incorporate current fashion trends, and those the two main ones, they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours. The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, but there was also, on the sideline, the though of maybe having a beeper function. Okay, so we can come back to that slide, if you don't have a note of those. I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this, to what we have so far. We're going to use a seven point scale, where one is true and seven is false. We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned, I'll call that slide back up, and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here. Does that seem clear? Any questions there? So we're going to look at these crite Yes, we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven. Is that okay? One is true, seven is false. Right. So I won't write all of that out again. It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, or A_, B_, C_, D_, E_, F_ to confuse it with the number rating. B_, C_, D_, E_, F_. This is where I realise how tiny I actually am. Criteria and rating. Actually, it might be an idea, if we each did give our own individual rating, and we could take an average at the end. How about that? Okay. So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques, and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's who. Okay. Criteria A_, the fancy look and feel. How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel. One is true, seven is false. My own rating for that would be a two. One is true and seven is false. I'll just go this way. Two. Okay. Two. A four, okay. Adding those up, we've got a six and a five, eleven divided by four is what? Uh two and three quarters, it that right. Two and three quarters? Okay. Two point seven five, there we go. Okay, criteria B_, criterion B_, technologically innovative. I would give that a three. Okay. Not that you're biased in that it the designer. The average oh, for you? You want your rating to be a two? Is that what you're saying? Okay. So, I'll work out the average for that again at the end. It's a very slightly altered Okay, and we're just waiting for your rating f Two point five, okay. Losing one decimal place, that's okay. So what are you rating for this one, Paw? Two, okay. So that is eight. That brings it down to two, nice and simple, yeah. Okay, ease of use. Easy to use? Based on what you've said there, I would say a one, true. Two. A two, okay. Two. I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy, shouldn't I? We'll just put almost two, because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places. Okay. Or we or if we want to really bring it down, we can do later. Um mm now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends, now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours. Right. So I'm just thinking, before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here. Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use? Right. So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do. Okay. And the spongy feel is no problem with that. Okay. In that case it's got to be a one for me. Yep. Everybody? Okay. That part was nice and easy. Okay. Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury. I don't think we've really touched on that a lot. We've we've discussed it, we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that. We've talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote control, if you're someone who's zapping, who's sitting like that, and we found so many people did, how do you minimise that on such a small device? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four. A five, okay. Four and a four okay. Twenty one is that twenty one? So that's four point two five. And finally, last but not least, easy to locate. Now we talked about voice recognition, we talked about a beeper, have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that? It was the I'm here thing, yep. And are we happy with the costs on that? That is going to be feasible, cost-wise. That sounds good then. I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that, just as we could volume on T_V_. So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms, or. Right. Okay. You built into the feature. Okay. Logical. That's a one for me. One and one, good. So, how do we feel about this? We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there. That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate. The lowest rating we've got, which is really n it's not terribly low, i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury. Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it, or do we have to make further modifications? We happy to go ahead? Yeah. I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that. I know. Okay. Well, I hope that's uh clear to the team. Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up? Good. Fine then. I'll just leave it there. Oops. Oh yes. Yes. But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit. So it can rest. It would just be a flat bottom with one curve. like a domed thing. Mm. The other curves at the sides, but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over. Yeah. What does it mean if you put point five for that? Mm-hmm. Right, okay. But it is gonna be part of the total cost, and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in, is there? There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing. So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there? Okay. Mm. Might do, if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours. S Has that not made any d if you click off that square now, has that not made any difference? Is it oh, it's brought it slightly down. So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing, is that going to make a difference? Oh, it's not made any difference, has it?. It's gone up again. Oh. It's brought it down slightly. Is there anything on the menu No. If we tr um. If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries, would that make a huge difference? And people are used to buying batteries, they're not gonna say I'm not getting this, 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control. Should we see what difference it makes? Um Yeah. Sure. But we're still working to um head o We can put in our recommendations. If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. But we need to work to that specification to start with. And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful, but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance. Um as you say, we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so Mm. Yeah. 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it. Yeah. So if we take voice recognition out we are. Are you sure? Sorry, not meaning to doubt your words there. Right. Are they really going to quibble about ten P_? Or point zero one of a Euro? Which is less than ten P_. That's today's kick off meeting,. Mm. I thought that's what it was. So we're okay. Although we had our separate tasks, there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to um bounce off each other. And I've certainly felt heard, listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take and adjust our remit where necessary. Yeah. Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line. And fake R_C_s. How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information? Could it've been better, was it adequate? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. It's really borrowing from other areas, it's, you know, bringing things from other areas in, it so it's I mean nothing is new, but it's applying it to a d in a different area. Absolutely, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the focus isn't on to that, yeah. I think it's really good that this has been very market research based, because just going back to mobile phones, I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really, you know, say is is obvious and visible. We see it in mobile phones a lot, and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from. There are innovations in that that people don't really want. I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with, and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake, and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based. Yeah. But forcing it onto people, yeah. It's things that, you know, they might want to buy the thing they really want. Mm. Mm. Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever, yeah. See I think I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone. Mm-hmm. But I think in the remit that we were given, it was very specific. I think we've done what we were required to do, and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things. I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for. I think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that I think people are really gonna want. I know. Maybe it will. Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it. Mm-hmm. Questionnaire. Questionnaire done. Oh, I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time. Oh, right. But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too? Yeah.
Speaker B: Is that for us? Okay. Yeah, shall I show? I'll show. Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and I'll I'll show you the presentation. Can I just nick your Whoa. Going a bit crazy over here. Thank you. Okay, so this is our look and feel presentation, the final our final presentation. And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there. Um It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour, either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something. This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached, but we can we can come up with that. Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns, so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it. Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say, it's yeah yeah, it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat. Yeah, yeah. And working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually, thinking about it now, could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well, so that you could probably get a bit of Yeah. Yeah. Um we decided that um the voice recognition system, it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of, so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. So you'd have something like where you'd shout out, where where is the remote and it'll shout back, I'm here, or something. And then yeah. It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something. It'll just shout out I'm here, or something to similar effect. Uh yeah, if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time, maybe. You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is. Um the standard, there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about. Um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers, it would need two separate P_C_B_s, so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling. And uh because, obviously, all T_V_s use this, the same infrared medium, we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data. And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer, just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on. Yeah, yeah, something like that. Yeah, on the front on the front side of that, yeah. So when you've actually got it open, it would be facing the T_V_. And then finally um on to the interface. The top screen, as we said, is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it, uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons, like the vo volume up and down, channel up and down, power on and off, and uh things to that effect. And now we've we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it, or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top. No d not not actually. No, not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing. And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics, as that is that's the company logo. There you go.. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah, two or three. No, three. Three. Mm yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'd give it a one. No, no, not at all. Yeah. Two. Two. Yeah. D_. One. Yeah. Yeah, that's No, no, the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue, but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised. Yeah, yeah, yeah and No, no, 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it, that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic. Yeah, I'll give it a one as well. Yeah. Mm. No. Yeah. It's meant to be. Yeah. Yeah, I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five, actually, 'cause Yep. Yeah. Yeah, it was it was uh a voice voice recognition, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that yeah, that's feasible. Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand it would be quite loud. So it would be s p yeah. Yeah. Yeah, one. I do realise that we might be being fairly biased, 'cause it is our product, but W I thin yeah, I think yeah. Mm. No. Yeah. It was a regular chip on print and Oh, no, no, no, the um Yeah, it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells, there should just be one. In the top, it's the number of c yeah. Yeah, and yeah, just a no, one reg v uh Yeah, one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker. And they're double curved. No. Y Two, 'cause it's two. Yeah, I'd say I'd say it was w yeah, I think I think it's One double-curved. And one no, 'cause one yeah, one's double-curved, and then the other one's a plastic. Yeah. And special colour. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, that's it's as an extra. So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there, because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get. Yeah, okay. Yeah, the push-button's one and L_C_ display one. And buttons Well yes. Yeah. No, we'll have No, no, you've got to click off to calculate it again. C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros. It could be in Dollars. And then it would be fine, because the exchange range would make it about twelve. No. Yeah, the standard, it um it would make one difference. The biggest one would be taking away if you took away If you to Yeah. If if you take away the voice, I I do I don't like to say it, but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it. Yeah i yeah. No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker. If you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five. They n n yeah, but you p minus three plus two. Yeah. But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now, because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product. Yeah. We c we could s Yeah, we could say Yeah, I s And then say we recommend Yeah. Yeah. That'll do it. Twelve point three five. Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty? Ah. Okay. Yeah. No. 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra, you could just take that out and that would be fine, yeah. Yeah, I think that's brilliant. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I'd say, as a team. Yeah. Find out from each other, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, I thought it it went really well and I yeah, I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out, although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's that's good. I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would've come out a d little different, but yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, well. Discuss which ones yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more, had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Vegetables. Yeah. No. Yeah, I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned. They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player, does anyone remember the remote control? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one? Yeah, just jazz it up a bit. Uh d they don't really think about it, because normally, the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship. They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player, the video player, the T_V_. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Well. I think that was just the the physical. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think yeah I don't from the market research. No. Yeah, it was I it's top secret. Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here. That's what it is. In your yeah. Okay. Is that it then? Awesome. Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your thing? I don't think. Yeah, the the s yeah. I think yeah, questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting. Mm.
Speaker C: Hmm. Thank you. Hmm. Hmm. Yep, me too. Mm-hmm. Yep. Me and William worked on a prototype, and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that. Yeah. I can hold it like Yeah, so It looks crazy. Um not now. Oh. Yeah. Oh, where are the hinges? 'Kay. You able to look? Yep.. The black and white touch screen wherein people can Right. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Ah oka Infrared could be here also. Yeah, here.. So when it's even if it's open here, the signals would go. Yeah. This one right here.. Which is No. Look up to it. Yay. So this is the one. Sorry. Evaluation.. Mm um I I think this is chip. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah, it's perfect. Is it everybody is going to evaluate, or just the Market okay. 'Kay. Yeah, so you can 'Kay. I would say four. Mm-hmm. Almost three. I think yeah. Oh sorry, I I got it wrong. The first one rating, I'm sorry. Can you just make it two? The first. Yeah, I I just it the other way. Uh in Yep, I just got two point f One is a, seven is false, okay. Two. Two. White. With for the plastic? Uh blue. Any Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah, because you'll be having a Because of the rubber case. One. Mm. Four. Voice r recognition. Hmm. You want me to b unplug that? That's all. Yes. Okay. Chip on print. Okay. Yep. Single-curved. Two curves, yeah. Single-cu. Plastic and rubber. Yeah. Plastic one and maybe rubber point five. No I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, we can put point five. Yeah, because there are I think it allows the point five, yeah. We can use that. It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually. We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic. Push-button. One. An One. I think we could change the battery also. Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery. Uncurved, flat. No, it just surprises one.. I don't think so. Ri I think it's in Euro. And going to a regular bat Yeah. What I feel is, customers never said anything about the battery. It's internal, nobody looks into the battery. But shape and colours, that's something we shouldn't comprimi Where's that special form? Mm mm mm. Mm-hmm. Make it costly. Yeah we are close to the budget. Two five. It's twelve point five maybe, then. I don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost. So half of the price would be I think it is the first one. So we are under the budget. Seems fine. Except voice recognition, everything is Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think we had a nice time. Yeah, I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody. It's not like people trying to cut each other. There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork. We came to a very predic creative design, yeah. Yeah, and uh Yeah, I think. And Sarah, you coordinated the work very well. Yeah. I think that was the best part of the 'Kay. Yeah, moving around the room. But I think it's good, like uh we spent times individually. I never thought of a remote control with a flip top. That's mine. Yeah, it's The thing is Yep, sorry, go on Sarah. Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones, like a real want to see a new launch or something like that. And new f television products coming up, but nobody giving uh much idea to this. Like Sarah was telling, everything's Right. Mm-hmm. Maybe fifty percent more. Yeah. Who knows? Yeah. There's a final questionnaire. Celebration, you didn't talk about that. Yeah.
Speaker D: If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time. Is that. three, apparently. Okay, you all switched on. I presume we're good to go. Okay, um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger, standard chip, um 'cause it can come in various different sizes, it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor. We wanted a stand-by function. The case material is gonna be soft, rubbery, changeable. Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design. Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit, keeping with the hip kind of feel. Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that. Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_. Okay? Prototype presentation. I think that would be you. Make sure the camera's Yes, yes you can. Wait a second, I'll get it out. Um Okay. You should have one of those things and you can just take it off. Ta-da. Right. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. So it's flush. Oh right, okay, yeah. So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections, 'cause it's the top part that's okay. Okay. I'm under the sofa. Or, that would be too complicated. Infrared. Like here. Okay. Actually, no, it would be it would have to be on the on the front. Oh right, yeah, okay, yeah, I've got you. It's still pointing, yes. Yeah, that would make sense. Okay. But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product once it's Okay. Thank you very much. Wrapping it all up, okay. Um I've now got evaluation criteria. It's to be presented. Okay. It's quite similar to what it was before, though. Sorry. Mm-hmm. Okay. Just write small. Yeah. That works. Mm-hmm. I would agree. Okay. I would say two. A two. It's just two point five for that one. I would say a two. I would say a two. One point seven f five. Okay, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. One. Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half, the material, minimises R_S_I_ it's meant to. Um maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small, but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much. So maybe because there's more space, it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between. It's quite obvious just big buttons. Um Four. A standard. It would be. And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in, then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room, you'd go into another room. One. I don't think so. I think we yeah. I think we're set. Do much apart from having a huge big Don't think so. Okay, thank you. Okay, I've got finance here now. I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it, if that's okay. Um. Thanks. Right. Now I presume that the screen will go blank, that um Okay. We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value. So are we still on for kinetic? Okay. See, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. Um it might have influenced our choice. Right, what's happening with the electronics? Double-curved. Oh, right, okay. Thanks. So, would there be two? One chip. Okay. One double curve. So what's a single curve then? So just one double Yeah. Um Mm. Um we've got plastic and rubber, haven't we?. Um Do you think? Okay. It would be like saying we're using See, it says case material. So we're not actually using plastic in the case, are we? It's including, it's including. Okay, we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half. Or sh we should just put it in as one, because the plastic is zero anyway. No, we don't step on anyone's toes. Okay, special colour, do we need that? N yeah, okay. Interface. Buttons Has that not gone up? Oh no, it was seven five it's changed not a lot. Oh, it's not calculated it. Okay, there we go. It's not a lot though. We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though, I think Okay, so the highest we've got is the electronics here. Um and the interface. Where's the where's the voice recognition? Right, okay. Well the kinetic is three. If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three. Oh, right. I keep seeing zero. Um We can do it some other way, we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition. We could do the voice recognition for, you know, business class or something, you know, like an upgraded version. You could choose to have that or not. So should we just change the design specification then? Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, we can make the price fit, and then say if we'd had our budget, we would've had this, because it also sets it apart from the crowd. They like their gadgets, they like something that's completely different. It's s something completely different associated with your company. Right, okay, so It's two point five. No, it's twelve point two five. Yeah well two, twelve point two five times two is twenty five, isn't it? I think the agenda one was where the um price was, wasn't it? No. Twelve point five. Well done, people. So is that uh got us covered for the electronics then? We don't need something else to take that place? Okay. Okay. Right, so we've done that. Okay. Product evaluation. We've done room for creativity, haven't we? Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make. Um I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork. um in the sense that um did you feel like a team? Or did you feel like uh autonomy? Mm-hmm. Thank you. How did you find it? Yeah. Yeah. I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like shot down, you know, y it didn't matter it saying what you thought, because if it wasn't something that was that relevant, then it didn't matter, 'cause it was just another idea in the field. I like that. Um teamwork. Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model. Um uh I'm still not caught up. But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all. Um Maybe. No, that was quite fun. Um means, whiteboard, digital pens, etcetera, what does that mean? Any ideas? Had time to kind of Yeah, 'cause we could just sort of say, sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that, rather than having to email it, yeah. But it was nice having it there. Um like the whole picture of the thing. Yeah, I think it's new ideas in general, rather than Mm. Yeah, no. Well they have to come from somewhere, don't they? And as sh as w sorry, you go. Um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls, remote controls, no one's thought about it particularly. I mean they're slightly different, so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's, 'cause it's w something we should think about, but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it. Mm. But then when it everything is really smart, and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table, it doesn't go, I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing, a funky item that's individual, individual to you, I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic, you would pray you would pay a lot extra, because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you. But people could have anything that they wanted. Because of the produ Mm. Yes. Yeah. Well, it's innovation for money's sake. The the people have to keep buying. Yeah. And you can't get you've got your handset that works fine, but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone, because the phones have moved on, things like that. Yes. It's madness. Um In closing There we go. Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased, but I think I don't know, d what do you think? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing? And the heating for the building, do you think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out? So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit, you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that. So maybe increasing it, you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at. But I think but you were saying that that's quite Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. It's a shame it won't ever get made. Maybe it will. Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it. Um the project has been evaluated well and truly. Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire. Oh, so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with, so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor, so good luck. I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds. Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks. Oh. Um yeah, just the last, I think. I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy. I just got con","The Project Manager went over decisions from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer presented the prototype and discussed its look, its internal components, and its interface. The Marketing Expert evaluated the product according to the initial product goals. The group then decided that enough of this criteria had been satisfied for the project to continue. The Project Manager presented the final cost of the device which exceeded the initial projected price point. The group decided to remove speech recognition but to propose to the management that it  remain in the design. The group then discussed their effectiveness as a team. All members felt that they interacted well and that they felt they could be creative. The Marketing Expert felt that the market-research based approach would help the project's success with consumers. The group did express, however, that the budget was overly constraining. The Project Manager instructed the group to fill out a final evaluation questionnaire."
50,"Speaker A: Okay, good morning. This is our first team meeting. I'll be your Project Manager for today, for this project. My name is Mark will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off. That's my uh that's the agenda for today. Well, of course we're new to each other, so I'd like to get acquainted first. So let's do that first, I mean Let's start with you, can you introduce yourself? You're our Marketing Expert. Okay, excellent. And you are User Interface Yeah. Excellent. Okay. What should it look like? Okay. Oh, let's kick it off. Oh, there we go. So, our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set, so, which has to be original, trendy and user-friendly. I took this off our corporate website. It's I think well it sums up what we need to do. We're inspired by latest fashion, not only electronics, but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design. That's why our product will always fit in your home. So apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market. So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want. So So we put the fashion in electronics. So that's what we need to go for. Anyway, we'll take this project in three steps, three pha uh three phase of design. First step will be the functional design. And that's basically what we're gonna do. Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards, so we can share information about So I'm gonna keep this short, since we had a technical problem. So skip through this. Uh. Okay. Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything, so to help with these, you have we have the SMARTboards here. We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation. I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board, so it's actually it's very easy. Like it says, very simple, you just take out the pen. Like you see here, I'll just take the take here. That's it, you just put it on the board. You see a pen here. You go here, just like using a pen. You can just draw whatever you want. It's like the eraser, can erase whatever you want. And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views, if you wanna change the format, you just either take out jus just like the pen, and whatever you want, your current colour, your line width, just to make the line bigger. So it should be really easy. This is to take the just take a new slide and back again. We're just gonna keep using this board all the time, so I think it will be it's very clear for everyone, I suppose. So I'll take this out. Okay. We'll use that later. Anyway. Yeah, just just just stuff that you wanna share, just put it in the in the project folder, like I put my presentation now. I'll put the the minutes of every meeting, I'll put them there too, so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever. So next, been here. Well, gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot. So basic idea is we have a blank sheet. Just try whatever you want, and like it says, draw your favourite animal. I think the creative genius should go first. So, draw us your favourite animal. Draw us a technical animal. Yeah, it's still erasing. So that's what we don't want. We want a high-responsive product. So It looks more like nuclear bomb. Let's go easy on it. Anyway, it should It It's supposed to be a dolphin, you like the freedom that it that it represents. What do you like? Okay. Well, our Marketing Expert. Show us an animal. Pick a pick a pick a clean sheet. Oh. Take a clean sheet first. Just press next. That's it. It's a cute elephant. It's a nice beard. Okay, so it's just a bee. So I suggest you make us the elephant in the market. The big and strong player in the market. This would be good. Okay, excellent. On to the next one. Press next. Yeah, it's up there. That's it. Sure looks smooth. What does it want? Okay. I agree. Yay, I'm supposed to draw the animal next. I introduce to the world the amazing ant. Great team-workers. Do everything to Uh really small, but together they're really strong. So I'm gonna give it a smiley face. Not sure where the p. Just put 'em here. Whatever. Think it need shoes. So I'm just too lazy to draw it all black, so That's the coolest ant ever. I love to draw ants. It's my hobby. Anyway Nah. Just I think it's very representative what we drew, I guess. Like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us. Just Yeah. You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have, and just make it a little distinct. Anyway. another beep to stop the meeting. See. Warning. Finish meeting now. Uh put this down. Examples. Well I guess we have a little little time extra, but Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work. So what do you guys think about The first idea is just very short. I'll start with you. What are y What are your first ideas for the new product? What The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control. Yeah, I guess so. Okay, so very intuitive design, I guess. Yeah, we want I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it. So I think I mean, really disabled people, yeah, might be a problem, but I think it's a little take it into consideration. Um yeah. I think we really need to cut the meeting short. You have anything you wanna share quickly? It should be light, okay. Um, let's see, where did I Let's skip that. Oh, this is it. Sorry, I skipped this sheet. What do we This Quick What we're going to Selling price, twenty five Euros. That's for you. The production price, twelve and a half Euros, approximately. Just go go for that. We'll reach the uh reach that profit. No, it's not much to work on. I'm sorry, I skipped it. Anyways, that's Yeah, this is it. Do you have anything you you came up with yet? About uh marketing transfer, whatever? Marketing I'm not sure what you what you came up with yet. You have anything to share? Or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short since we're supposed to stop. Okay. Anyways, the the personal coach will give you the your p your personal assignments and everything. So we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes. I'm sure we have that. Yeah, thanks for attending. I'll see you back here in thirty minutes.
Speaker B: Morning. My name is Xavier Juergens, I'm the Industrial Designer, and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today. First one is uh what happens inside the apparatus, second is what is uh the apparatus made of, and the third is what should it look like. Uh-huh. Mm. Okay. Okay, you should press next. Okay. Okay, well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger. My drawing skills are really bad, so. They are really bad, my drawing skills. I'm not sure how the legs should go, but Uh these are stripes. I've picked this animal because it's very fast. It is uh it knows exactly what it wants. Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources. Uh well, basically uh it hunts for prey, but it does it always in a very well-thought way. Uh it knows exactly what it wants. It never kills an animal uh just for the killing, so it's very efficient. And it tries to do everything as fast as possible. And it always goes for uh security, in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything, security, speed and efficiency is important. And I think uh those things we can use. Yeah. Oh. Hmm. Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of, it should be something light. That's it speaks for itself, but some uh Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good luck everyone.
Speaker C: Good day. Nick Broer, User Interface Designer. I'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view. The creative genius? Thank you very much. Well, I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing, so I'm not really good at drawing animals, but uh the animal which I Oh. Pen. Uh format. Else my animal will be like king-size. I pretty much like a dolphin, because of its uh its freedom basically. Let's see. A head. actually worked with this. It's like uh it's a very Uh high-tech. Bit low-responsive though. Prefer pen and paper. It doesn't look like a nuclear bomb. This thing isn't doing what I'm What I want. So Yeah, well it does look like a nuclear bomb. I'll just finish up real soon, because I'm So it doesn't really look like a dolphin, but then again, this is all new for me. Like the ocean, like swimming. Do that in my spare time, so that's basically an Now we can forget this ever happened. It's not really that responsive, no. And you was making comments on my dolphin. You picked a hard one, didn't you? Got it. You've done this before, haven't you? Well, I basically had a question. Do uh Are we going to introduce a multi remote control? Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in Just for T_V_ remote control. Okay. Well, I was thinking about design remote control, with our uh motto and all. Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with. No rational changes or whatever, 'cause it revolutionary changes, yes. Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product. So that was something I wanted to add, and perhaps some usability aspect. T_V_ is becoming central in most homes. Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh, yeah, to be able to use it as well? Yeah. Okay, well that's not that much to work with. Mm, good luck.
Speaker D: Morning. Yes. Um my name is Dirk, Dirk Meinfeld. Um I will be uh Pr Project the Marketing Expert. And I will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new produ project product. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Very nice dolphin. Um an animal. I like the elephant. What? Yeah. Um Oh yeah. Oh, a blank. Okay, next. Free, I like the elephant. It's big, it's strong, so uh uh Oh, it's a little bit You have to hold it, right? Hmm. It's a beautiful animal. Oh, you have to p press it pretty hard. With a smile on it, it's very important. Yeah. And uh not to forget its tail. Oh. Yeah, it's okay. Yes. I will beat the dolphin. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah. Experience with the tiger. What? They are Okay uh-huh. Oh. Mm. Okay. Uh hard worker. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Uh Yeah. But Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Selling price. international. Um about what? Marketing? Um no, not really yet, but I've some ideas and I will uh say it uh Okay. Okay. Yes.","The goal of the project is to design an original, trendy and user-friendly remote control for TV. The team comprises the project manager, the marketing expert, who is looking at user needs, the user interface designer, looking at usability, and the industrial designer, working on the engineering and materials. The project will be completed with three further meetings: the following meeting concerns the functional design. The project manager gave a quick overview of the equipment available. The remote  needs to be produced for 12.50 euros in order to be sold for double that amount. The whole team tried out the SMARTboard, by drawing their favourite animals. Afterwards, they discussed briefly their first ideas, including the use of light materials and usability concerns."
108,"Speaker A: . Yep. Okay. Yep. Can I have your cable please? Thanks. Okay so I was looking at trend-watching. Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information. I was given a brief executive summary, and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at. And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that. Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design, which I think we've kind of already discussed before. Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative. And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own, but this just backs it up. And thirdly the remote would be easy to use. As far as fashion update, we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths, shoes and furniture. So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote, but we can try. Um and also, as opposed to last year, this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel. Okay so from that um, as we've already said, we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel. Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design. But I think that, even if it's very subtle, we need to kind of trick our consumers, so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that. Um for technologically innovative, we've talked about the tracking device. We brought up the idea of having two pieces, which we could discuss further. And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface, discussing some of those, um that we could change a little bit. We need to keep it simple, have limited buttons, which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for. Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables. I don't know, I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Or with exterior designs. But my question is, I mean the stereotypically speaking, you kind of picture males with their remote controls, and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside. So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable, or I don't know, different options for female, male target groups. And then the spongy feel. I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there. C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls. So that's that. That's what I was thinking yeah. Yeah. So when you buy your remote you can buy various coverings. Personalise your remote. Mm-hmm. Dunno. Spongy? Y probably not yeah. Mm. No. Hmm. Mm. Like a covering. Yeah. The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts, so they can remove it. Mm. Mm. Bright citrus colours yeah. Oh yeah. Yellow and grey. I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous, like Well we kinda do yeah. And if it's yellow? Grey buttons yeah. Mm. Oh. Nice. Could look like a fruit bowl. 'Kay. So is the two piece idea out? Or have we not decided? Oh right okay. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Well what about what you said, like putting the finger grips just on top of the plastic? Yeah. So then for the scroll, are we going for the iPod type? Yeah? Okay.
Speaker B: Yep. Oh it was sort of banana shaped. Those like, yeah, sort of spongy ones. What's it called? Cust you personalised, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Why can't I see the crazy. Um yeah I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to, will use the, consumer will use the actual device. Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent, um, try and get some inspiration. But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had. Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they, the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology, where you can program questions into such devices. They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question, you program the answer, and the machine responds accordingly. Um okay. There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote. Um there's a graphical use, where you you look at pictures and well on a screen. A command line where you obviously type things in, and you get a response. Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes. You can't really see that picture well, but there's various different remotes, once again with lots of different buttons on, making it more complicated. So, then I had a look at new products that are on the market. Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise. Um this is the voice, there is a voice recognition remote control, which can control mus multiple devices. I have a there is a picture. You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice. Store up to eighty speech samples, controls four devices, T_V_, cable, satellite, V_C_R_, D_V_D_ and audio. And you can record your own v verbal labels, that are connected to remote control functions. So the technology is there. Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting, where there has scroll down functions on the side. You can sort of just make those out. And then on the right is obviously an iPod, which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there, and really is, and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through. That is a possibility. And nothing's simpler really. Um then there's things like this, which is a a a kid's remote, where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before. So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch. And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control. So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components, maybe it can have more components you know, different remotes. Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices, as to what, you know, things you use. Sometimes an arrow pointing down, which may suggest volume down, could become confused just as a V_ for volume. Just little things like that, which would need to be made clear in the design. Um I think, d carrying on from what I've already said, a user friendly remote with minimum buttons. Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing, where if it was to have a speech recognition thing, you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit. And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier, as the actual remote. Um I don't it could be a graphical display, the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus. Stuff like gets more and more compli complicated. And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed. And that is it. Why am I Oh yeah. Just. Where are we? Uh. Just to sort of show you. M they've even got things like that. Huge things. Which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah? Yeah. Yeah. And that yeah. Yeah. See. things.. Why's my screen crazy? Mm. Would you have to leave it by the window? yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff. So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic. But then where do people hold it? Just all be sort of spongy. So you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it, like a screen? Like the iPod? Right. Yeah. Yeah. Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen, and then j just sort of that initial shape we had, just which is uh sort of banana-esque. So that's thing if we did it yellow. And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit. They wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior. They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing. Yeah. Mm. You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose. In different ye yellows. I don't suppose we have to stick to co Stick to the colours yeah. Mm grapefruit. Yeah.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. and if it if it was done yellow, which is a company colour. Yeah. On the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey. Yeah. It could and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl, on the coffee table, and then people would always know where it was. Yeah. Yeah. Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery. And the base station might not be necessary. Yeah. Yeah. Just just maybe yeah. Just a little bit of. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I think so. I think
Speaker C: Okay. Right. Okay. Alright. Is everyone here? Okay. This is our conceptual design meeting. And I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes. Um then each of you will have your presentation, um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control. And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up. Um I'll go through the mee through the minutes first. Um, we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available. Um we decided that, or we know that we need to use company colours, company logo. Um and our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users. Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before. People thought their remotes were ugly, um um that remotes zap a lot. Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons. Um and that they often lose the it's easy to lose a remote. Um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple. Um And uh some sort of locator. Either a button or tracking device. Um And that it should look different than what's out there. Um Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition. The younger people said they wanted it, older people did not. Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it, and that it was probably a gimmick, that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves. Um Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote. Um the simple versus the um the complex. The simple one being better for a user, the complex better for an engineer. Um Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote, something simple. Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote, because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity. Um we would just have a T_V_ remote. Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote. Have it s be something that looks different. And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work. Um from energy source, um uh what we would use. Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable. Um How that would power the remote and the lamp. If we were to to have one. Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip, which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_. Um I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be. Um Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand. And with a, just a few buttons. Just the basics. And with a scrolling um function also. Okay and I will leave that, leave it at that. So Marketing? We're watching trends. I suppose that you can have this. A banana shape? So possibly like a uh, sorry, just to butt in for a second. Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones? You have one with a flag, and one with a banana and one that's a spongy feel to it. You can Mm various covers. We could leave that to the cover department. We all know they've got nothing to do all day. Notice the giant dog bone shape? Also good for animals. What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium? Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go. Yeah. So the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want? Or the rubbery we cannot? 'Kay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Is that an option, a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots? What about a smell? T to the remote? Yellow and grey. Grapefruit. I would say, if I were to make a decision, I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance. Um Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer. It's it's yellow. It's curved. It's sort of couple of couple of grey stripes. We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over. It would look like a banana just sitting on their table. Rather than rather th Maybe the holder, if we were to have a holder, it could be shaped like a fruit. Could be, it could be an ape or a fruit bowl. Hey we could have a variety of options here. Do you have more to your presentation? Oh. Okay. I'm gonna plug in here real quick. If I could. Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here. Um ow. Ow. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting. Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source, um the chip-on-print, and the case. Probably case um material. And probably a shape also. Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape, what, what the type is. And what kind of supplements we'll have. Um Energy source I think we've, I think we've decided batteries, although not exciting, are probably our best bet. And we have five minutes. 'Kay. So Um I guess we should pick the case then. If we go with the plasticky case, or the the plastic case, um then the chip-on-print is still kind of, we could have either or. We could have a complex one or a a non-complex. But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us?. Okay. So we would, we would have the L_C_D_ screen? 'Kay. So I guess the case would be plastic, with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it. It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe. Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right? 'Kay. So I guess that, is that, is that about it? So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this? Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes. Um Here's what's gonna be going on. Um Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design. Um Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design. Corrine we'll want a product evaluation. And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh maybe and and get us a prototype. Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface. So that basically just be working on the prototype, uh we'll accomplish your other two actions. Alright. Okay. Let's do it.
Speaker D: Alright. That's industrial design for cranes, stuff like that. Makes sense, makes sense. Uh Well let's see. I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior. Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there, and that we do have to fit the stuff in there. I've more information on possible materials um as well. What we can and cannot do. Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you what we're talking about here. Okay. The details of the components' design, as you can see there, what we have is the board, main board of the remote control. The underside, that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip, which is the, what we were talking about, this was is the device to recognise the signals the input, and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal, which later on is being, is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it. Um So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself. Its job is to wait for you to press a key, then to translate that key press into infrared light signals, um that are received by the television. When you press a key um you complete a specific connection. The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed. It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button. Right. Pretty clear. Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light. The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light, and seeing the signal reacts appropriately. This is the circuit board from the other side. Um the lower part of it, I don't know if you can see that properly, with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over. Um you can see the circuit board itself. That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market. Um what you do is you have, don't have cables, but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board. These are the actual keys that are being pressed. They close the electric circuit. That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side. That would be behind here. Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there. Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it. Um the way it works is that you have the keys here. The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side, which closes the circuit here. And thus gives on the signal. Now this is the simple version. Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time. We are talking something more complicated of course, it's going to be more expensive as well. And not only that. Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell, or in the material that we could use for our outer shell. Um I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic, rubber, as well. Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls. So it's pretty squishy. That would that would serve that purpose. Um we could also use wood, or titanium. Oh fya I don't have an information on that. However our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium, so I assume, I'm, I was given an okay to use it. It certainly is an expensive material, I'm aware of that, but I was given an okay. But there are certain restrictions to certain materials. Now let's first go through the list with the materials. So we what we can use is plastic, rubber, wood and titanium. Can also mix these. Um as for the energy source, um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting. Um what we could use is, or what I was offered, or what we could use, is a basic bateer battery. Right? Uh a dynamo. Interestingly enough. Um we could use solar cells. Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy. Such as like watches you know. Where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy. So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really. You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right? Um solar cell is interesting. May fail though, every here and there. Mm. Yeah. Or you know you lose it, it lies behind the couch for a week and yeah mm. Always the you But exactly. Um the kinetic energy thing um might work, um but the same problem. You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work. So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery. Which also makes a base station basically obsolete. We don't need that then. Um However our interface options are push-buttons. In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert. Um However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option. And they are possible. We have an okay for scroll wheels. Okay. Um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well. This however may exclude certain um materials. If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control, then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement. Hence we might not be able to put it in there. So um There's also restrictions to, when it comes to the chip. If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented, um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well. I don't have any details to, when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference. I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip, but that's not up to me to decide really. So that's for the for the scroll wheel. Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip, so I'd say rather not go for for that. Let's see now. Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control. But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells, I assume right? Or is anybody still alright. Alright. Uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume. Um Um With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design. We would just be able to make it flat and and um yeah a straight design pretty much. Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions. You can have an L_C_D_ screen. Um but therefore no rubber will be used. Alright? So plastic yes, titanium yes, but this will of course influence the form. With plastic, as I understand it, you can use any form. Um latex is tricky. Or rubber and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form. So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular, uh add an L_C_D_ screen, and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium. Or wood even. Um if you wanna make it a particular shape, use plastic. Add an L_C_D_ screen, add a scroll wheel, that'll be fine. Or make it just push-buttons. Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options. Maybe not the nicest feel. Or not much originality really. With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it, but we cannot add scroll wheels, and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen. That's the tricky thing. S Certainly can be done yes. Um yeah. if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all. Like say just the underside or so then it can be done. I assume. Yeah. So The fruit design um How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously, but uh give it like the surface of an orange, banana, whatever. You name it. Just design-wise. Mm. Nice one. Mm. Well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though, that's yellow and grey. So what have we, lemon, banana, is Grapefruit is what we'd go for, when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps. But mm. Well we have it banana-shaped already, kind of. So Right. I it's yellow. Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana? There you go. It could be an ape. Yeah. That's pretty much it. I informed you about the materials, what the interior has to look like, and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go. Sure. Hang on. There you go. Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base, having one of them be a base station, but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions, or you take out the smaller piece. We can still do that. However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much. So um which then, as I understand it, would probably limit the, limit again the the the use of certain materials, because they would be too expensive. Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them, or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on. You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there. But could be done, of course. Right. Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print, as I said, the the more advanced features you want, um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive. Uh if you want just a normal button version, the chip-on-print is gonna be a cheap one. Right? Yeah. as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls, yes.. M more of a l lamination perhaps. Yes. It does. Right. Right.","This is our conceptual design meeting . I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . Um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . Um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . Um And that it should look different than what's out there . Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . And with a scrolling um function also . I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . Or with exterior designs . Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? Personalise your remote . Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . And then on the right is obviously an iPod , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . And nothing's simpler really . Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . Can also mix these . Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . Um solar cell is interesting . May fail though , every here and there . Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . our interface options are push-buttons . however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen . And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , but uh give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . So is the two piece idea out ? Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery . Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . So I guess the case would be plastic , with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ? Yeah I think so . Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh maybe and and get us a prototype . basically just be working on the prototype , uh we'll accomplish your other two actions ."
32,"Speaker A: Mm-hmm. Alright. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Alright. Alright. Easy to use? I think that's your ta Mm. You Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway, so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device. Alright. Uh you think? Mm. Mm. Alright. Yeah, among the old people, yeah. Right, I am going to tell you something about the components design. Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties. This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device. And the materials? Um I have heard several things, so I uh I'll have to change that on the way. But uh the case? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic. But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong. It should feel strong. So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient. We should move to uh something Well yeah. Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough, but it doesn't have a really really tough look. So Yeah. Also Yeah. Mm-hmm. But we'll return to that. Uh the buttons of course rubber, I think everyone agrees. And electrical cables, copper is all pretty basic stuff. The chips made of silicon, I guess. I think that's the best uh way to do it. And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb. Then I've uh had a few findings, made a few findings. Uh the target audience product style. Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like, as you said, uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that. They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style. But of course that's not our uh things this. So this is things we must not do. And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people, which is of course our uh group, the people we aim at. Um under forty five years old. Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours. Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said, that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking. But they like soft materials, uh so we might uh we have to consider that. And also they like curved round shapes. So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want. And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here, that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices, gaming devices, should define the characteristics of the device. But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device, so we don't really have to consider that. Mm. Well I also have um several examples of uh styles, so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean. Uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff. It was not very uh interesting uh, very classical looking, but that's n that's not what we want. We have these kind of things. I don't know what exactly they are. It looks like Well you know uh you recognise the shapes, it's very primary colours, uh bright colours and uh round shapes. You also uh see uh this device, it's not very round and Fruity of course. Yeah, it uh That's true. And uh well round shapes, primary colours. You can see it all here. And of course uh this famous device. I think as you know something uh some devices like this. So to give you an idea of uh This has a strong look. Although it's plastic, it's it's grey to to to give it iron look. That's uh Yeah. Well we have to make a Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control. I don't think that's very practical, but But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour. Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking, it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger. 'Cause if you look at this, it it doesn't look very very strong, becau But this is plastic, and and this too, but The feel? Uh alright. Well Mm-hmm. And I Then I have some more findings. Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device, uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery. I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course. But solar energy is not very practical inside a house, because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun. And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical, I think, for uh for a simple remote, that's a bit, oh, that's a bit uh That's a bit uh much. And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case. Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium. That that's the information I received. If you use the curved case, uh a curved case, double curved then you can't use titanium. Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look. And uh now the the shape, yeah, a curved case. Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something. Uh a more modern look not plain, long box style, but I'll draw it, but maybe later. And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape, than if you have uh. Um anyway Um f as uh for the buttons, simple push buttons. No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that, because it makes more complex and expensive. And, uh as we agreed, we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device. Because it makes it also more complex and expensive. But we do use an L_C_D_ screen, so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip, which is more complex and expensive. But It's worth the trouble I think, because Uh rubber is a soft material, I guess. Uh soft enough. So that's uh basically what I want to talk about. Oh, yeah, I understand. Yeah. Yeah. But it it's n nice for young people. They like gadgets. Yeah. If it's cheap. Yeah. Can you draw it now of uh Can you draw it now? Mm. Alright. button, yeah. I suggest a banana shape. Because of the fruity uh fashion. Yellow and Yeah alright, yeah. Just a hunch. Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course? And then below is the L_C_D_ screen? Alright, yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh by pe pressing the menu button again. By pressing the menu button again, you go uh out. It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. But you can men you can press menu again to get out. No. Why would you put it uh then, and where is the recording uh the microphone? Where would you put it? Uh-huh. Microphone, yeah. Yeah I understand. Uh but uh we could uh d do, but it's perhaps more expensive, uh the speaker on the back or something. Alright. Well yeah yeah yeah. I can live with it. They do they don't look fruity enough. Tho Yeah those But it doesn't uh the Yeah, ok Yeah. But it it must not look too childish of course huh? But it Yeah. Not not too strange. No. Exotic yeah. We have t Yeah, yeah. I will design it, we design it later. So we'll get to that later I guess. The specific shape. The Our sources. But uh we should decide now. So we have to uh put it in one uh document. Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document, and then uh put the answers after the subjects. Yeah. Well we have to decide all these things? W we can uh override them? Well a case? Uh that's me. Uh I suggest Well what do I suggest actually? Uh s solid, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. So we have titanium. Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote, so not the front, could be titanium, to give that uh strong look. And then the front is made of plastic. And you can put that on and off, and switch it. No but you have titanium of course. Uh you have the best of both worlds. And of course, yeah, you have the the the plastic front end. But you also have the titanium. Yeah of course, but yeah you have to make a decision. I guess so. Uh titanium I sh I think uh Huh? Well, well the According to my sources, uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available, and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it, if we want. Mm. Mm. Yeah, I think that's a nice trade-off. Alright. Yeah, for the front and then titanium for the back. For the non-removable uh part. Well but The titan titanium isn't isn't v very Yeah, i it doesn't uh curves. No uh I nei. Titanium is very No no no, but you know b Titanium is very basic colour, and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front. I dunno if if you disagree, but I think it's doesn't matter very much. And even if it does uh doesn't match, it will uh People like mm colours that don't match. Cop copper uh material. Excuse me? Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh Yeah in Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh Oh external? Well A coffee grind doesn't have Na ja. Never mind the coffee grind. Right? Alright. Mm-hmm. Yeah the the the front w Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. For the for the launch, yeah. So e th then a c couple of basic colours. Not not very uh sim Not Yeah. Yeah. Very boring, yeah. The most boring fronts possible. Yeah but you you can have some basic colours, and then we come with the special patterns on them, and and uh And uh Uh we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design. Because yeah we have the sketch but Alright, yeah. The price? We all agree on that. Yeah. Together or uh Yeah together. How Yeah yeah, but how do I Some Some non functional tasks. You're fired. No but Well, can we talk about something else? Uh Uh no I don't know anything, but maybe uh anyone else uh Yeah? Round I think. To make it as uh as round as possible. But now I see the Well th th th th th that depends uh. Well we uh We we j we'll just give them an uh We'll design it, and then they can give comments on it. Well yeah. Um I think um a logo, our company logo, and the slogan should be or could be Yeah, why not? If there's enough space, you can put uh We'll we'll Well, our slogan is not very long. It's just a simple What is it? You c But you can put it on the back, on the titanium part. The logo and the and the Yeah they do. Well yeah. Right corner, or maybe here in the middle? Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board, and you can remove the front. I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing. But am I the only one, or uh No not on the front, but on the backside. Uh I think it's a nice idea, to make it more recognisable, that the next to the logo you have the slogan. To make more uh of an impression. Not too big. No, very small. Not on the entire back, but uh just very small. But readable enough of course. But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design. Lo Uh yeah. Or maybe here in the middle, but we'll decide later. Do you do you see a bit of the of the um of the uh titanium? O on the front? Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium, the front is the the upper part, and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen. So Yeah. No no betwe of between we can do but But then you have two parts of front, two fronts that This enti entire bottom? And then the lower part is titanium? I think that's nice, yeah. Yeah. I like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone. Maybe you can show it. It also has the those two distinct uh Mm bit like this. Uh it's uh Yeah yeah. That uh Yeah. Maybe a nice touch, yeah. I think I'm going to buy it. That's a bit too much, but No, no no no, but I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually. Of course, because it's my design but No our d our design, alright. But don't erase my cat. I want to preserve it. What are you doing chief? Yeah until the until the beep goes. But I don't uh Do we have to stay here, or I think we have to return first. The high powers from above will have to tell us, yeah. Yeah, touch-pads, yeah. We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote. No just kidding. Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too, because it becomes too too too too stressy. But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality, so Yeah. Bless you. Mm. Too much? Well they uh I think that's good. We all had uh our talk and we agree I guess on uh several thing, on most uh on things. Yeah you have to push harder. Mm. Where's the good old chalk board with the the green board with the, how do you call it, chalk, yeah. Yeah, maybe. Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated, we can draw a thing quick, and then before it uh goes off again. Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here? Huh? Yeah. Guess so. A happy hol happy holidays.
Speaker B: Okay. Uh door is closed. Well, let's begin. Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting, we'll have to hurry up. Um well I'll start with the presentation again, the agenda. Yo. So. Uh This one I think. Uh yeah. Well alright. Um well, I'll show you the notes. It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting, but I'll show them. We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design. Um Then we'll have to dec decide about the control, the remote control concepts. I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder, which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take. So this time we exactly know what to decide about. And then we'll close again. Uh Well these are some examples, but we'll talk about them later. We'll first look at your uh presentations. Alright? Walter will uh start again this time? Yo. 'Kay. 'Kay. Less. Well, yeah. L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts. Well, easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh Functional is not an issue, and then easy to use. Well we have to choose one of them. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. We'll we'll look at uh. 'Kay. So Well Yeah, well Yeah. B Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year. Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different. Yes. Yep, alright. Wood is popular. Aha. Yeah yeah yeah. Alright. Nice, uh well show us. Well maybe it it it is, but it doesn't look strong. So maybe But we still have to look at our price of course. Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh Yeah? Yes. Sports uh, they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh Huh? That's nice. All the results? Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Nai. Uh no. It's t terrible. Alright. Hmm? Yeah, alright. Yeah. And it's round. Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour. So uh those kind of things you can you can combine. No, it isn't. Okay. Yes. So, if you ti Well You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something. So it it looks pretty but it feels strong. No titanium. What do you exactly mean with double curved? Double curved? It it mean Yeah, well okay. Well This soft material thing from uh Yeah. Alright. Okay. We will take that. And then uh Mike? Okay. Oh That's interesting. Okay. But you can also say that, when you say something, it does some function. Oh. That's a bit uh Yes. I understand. But it has no functionality for our remote at all. Hmm. So you put a menu in the L_C_D_? Ah. But then we should also have an uh an Okay button. Just uh There is already a blank. Yes? So Yeah. No m Next year that's out. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. And what's the menu button? But how did How do you get out of the menu then? Yeah. Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay. Uh Yes, well but bec because when you push Menu you get in, and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice. And Well that's also the Okay button. That's you you should have uh Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out. Exit. Well, it's just a choice. Huh? Yeah? Okay. Well, okay, alright. Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make. I'd I agree. Fine. Yeah. Yes? Too big. They're all black. Hey, that one I like. No. The remote. Terrible. It's it's all too much buttons. Too many buttons. That's Well, that's too expensive I think. Alright. Yeah. Okay. Huh. Mm no. 'Kay. No, not very strange. It still has t Yes. Th a a kind of bridge. So it f falls over the hand. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. Well I have at home a remote with a bridge. It's just a half round half half circle at And then it falls exactly over the hand, and that's very nice. That's It feels comfortable. Yeah. Yeah, alright. Um where did I put it? Um conceptual phase, I think this is it. I got this from our friends. So Uh yeah the conceptual design. These are a few examples which we have to decide about. All the the materials from the case, uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story. Um Yeah. Um now from the user interface, your uh package? Um where No well, that's more like the buttons where they have to come. And um B a bit of, yeah well, a bit of uh design. Yes, but we have to decide about these now. And uh the trend-watching. So as you said, fruity is in, well sells good. Wow. Uh these things. Uh yes. Um so if we uh go through them Yeah well uh Why should I uh Yeah. So What what kind of properties should it have? Well we just listened. You know what? Alright. I've uh Titanium back, plastic front. Okay. Um well I am going to put it in here, uh because we can uh look. I Um solid feel and trendy look. So material, um hard plastic for the front? Okay. And well the the electrical cable is just normal uh. It's uh from uh our coffee uh Of course. Well uh all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work. So The chip is normal silicon. Uh the buttons are normal, etcetera. Okay? So that's just easy. Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes. The conceptual specification of the user interface? Um well we have our beautiful drawing. Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder, and then I'll put it in our end report. Yes, you can Mm yeah. You can uh put some uh which button is what. Okay. Um the trend-watching included these days. And what do we? We thing that fruit and bright colours are Yes. We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot. Uh those kind of things. Yeah. Launch different lines at once. We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time. Yeah. Come on. We still have to make those fifty million, yeah?. The most ugly. Two. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Um well the buttons etcetera, we get from Mike. Uh this fruit and bright colours, yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour, we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch, when we uh well introduce our remote. Yes. Yes. Well I'll have to, before I get another warning for five minutes, I'm going to get Where is my mouse? Uh where is my mouse? Oh yeah. Um this is it. Well, um this we have. Uh basic stuff. Interface we have. Supplements, L_C_D_. Maybe a a cheap voice recording. Well Yes. Alright. Individual actions. Industry designer,. User Interface, Mike. You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard. That's what I got uh to hear. Yes well we'll get it to hear that I think. But I think so. Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it This is the SMARTboard, so Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype, and y Well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera. Yeah. So you'll get it on your em on your laptop. Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project yeah project evaluation. So um, what are you going to do? Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means, but uh you'll get uh the specifications. Yeah. That's why I uh But uh How long do we still have? Yeah. Why does Ah f fuck you. Heh? We can't get Ts It doesn't work any more. We can't save them. So we'll just have them uh standing there. No. It's a bit uh bit a pity. Well we still have uh more than five minutes. Um So what are we going to do? I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue. Oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote. Also the slogan? On the We put the fashion in electronics. We put the fashion in electronics. On the top. Yeah. Well in in in the right top corner? And well you c On the back, you can put uh h At the bottom, you can put the logo with the Yeah. Just just small. Yeah well Carved into the material. No, you you can carve it into the titanium at the back. Well, management would like it. The front side, no no l no slogan. Sorry. Yes, slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front but not exchange uh Uh? Hmm? Uh when changing fronts. Alright, that's decided. Five minutes left. So a bit of titanium between? That's a bit Oh that that's that's pretty cool. No? Yes. I already have uh all kinds of uh filth between the mobile. Yeah. Round forms. Yep. Yeah. What? So round where? Oh, yeah. Yes, that also sounds uh pretty uh neat. We want it. And it's only f twenty five Euros. Come on. No that's nothing. The Phillips remote uh costs more. Well uh you two are going to work together. You'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop, and then uh you uh Well I think we can, I just It's Yeah, o Oh Oh, we have a one. So, you can uh draw a Yeah. Well I'll get a I'll get the message. No, I think uh Well you'll Maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here. Or get your mouse. Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates. I always have a mouse next to my laptop. I hate these Ugh. And in your remote control. So we put a touch pad on it, and say ha ha. Yeah. We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but But they do want some gadgets. So that's wha what we're doing. Well we won't. Our bosses will be rich. Well, that's not bad, is it? Mm. So Oh. Oh he's totally off again. Well But when I start here, it's here. So is it Nope. Yeah. Let's go. Finish the meeting now. Alright now we know what to do, so Um Message? No, get away. Um I I'm not sure. Maybe you Yeah. Well you'll have to work on this one. Yeah. That's a good idea. Well Good luck.
Speaker C: Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use. Bananas. Yeah. Yeah. Soccer fronts. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. And it it doesn't have to be strong, also. Only the feel. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material. Because people like that. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier. Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented. Um we must decide where, this meeting. Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems, um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines. And um well they're cheap, so we could use them now. Um it's not really speech recognition, it's more um like you can um talk to the chip, uh record the message and record an answer, and then once you uh talk to the remote, then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left. So if I say hi Mike, and you have recorded uh hi Mike back, then you will get that. No it doesn't does not do anything. But i it's just a Yeah it's it's cheap. No but that's the gadget they want, or the gimmicks. Yes, we we should really uh include that one, I think. Um Well, as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote. Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen, uh instead of uh extra buttons. I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that. Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a, well, conventional remote, I think. For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable. A voice recognition can be uh implemented. And uh I drew an example, but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do. Hmm? Well I have the I can draw it again, and I know what I did wrong. I didn't tick the note bo box in the. Um Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen. Yes. Um I shall draw this. If it uh works. Mm so have I. Nah. Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct. Yeah just uh the numbers. These these will be bigger in the the real design. This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen. And with this you can uh, yes, go to through the menus and that can Um the video button should be uh an apart button, because you want it to uh t, yeah, to use it fast within one uh click. Um it's Hmm? This button can also be the Menu button, we use in the menus Well we we can add another button here, but Yeah. Ah right. Well you you No no, we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button. Ah once you have an extra Menu button, you don't need that that extra option. You have uh redundancy. Yeah, if we decide to uh to implement that, maybe we should. Well they that could be anywhere. That's very small. It could be uh down here. Um. Well, not here. I yeah I suggest here. But that's just a little gap. Yeah. Well the speaker and the microphone, I think, are the same uh little hole thingy. Yeah. Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines, so they won't be uh very expensive. But This is my suggested design. Um Yes. And oh I think as you can see so, the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end, or at the bottom. But Oh, um I had some uh examples. You can uh But I did not like it very much, but Well these are quite obvious, very ugly remote. Um No, well th Yeah. Well not all. Uh this is for children but th No. W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to. Well this is a terrible Um this looks Yeah. This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens. I think we should, if it's um possible, uh one with colours, but I don't know uh Too expensive? Alright. Well Nah. Ha, even more. N Well Yeah, this is what we've just done. Right? Ah right. Not everything. Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine. I think we Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard, yeah, some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front. That Just like um most cell phones are. Yeah. Yeah. No but you you have this Yeah. Yeah, you have the re remote in your hand like this. So you feel titanium. Yeah. And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to. Yeah. Well any colour Yeah, then you you paint it in the colour you want it. The plastic is is the colour you want it. So Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Well titanium is neutral. Hmm. Yeah. Well Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours, and they don't use uh wood. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. The electrical cable uh does No we don't use an electrical cable. Yeah inside, but this is for the coffee uh machine. Yeah, but that's not what's meant here, I think. Yeah. Well I got a better one here and I will um The shared folder. I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah that's the whole idea of the front. Yes. But that's for later on. The fronts y you can do anything with them. Yeah, right For the uh initiative uh launch. Mm. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so, so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more. Yeah. Red red, blue and green you give them or something, and then you can give them uh other ones. Yeah we should do that. Mm. Yeah, we can do that. But bu we stay we stay here or something? Ah right. And take it to our rooms and uh Ah, specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. Yeah. Um Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers? Yeah I I I also uh thought Yeah. And these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped with a square one in the middle. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume, I think. Yeah, it depends, but If you turn up the volume, you always see this thingy go up. Yeah. Yeah alright. Mm. Uh I I'd say only the logo. Too much text and it gets too too busy. Well it's quite a long phrase. Ah the logo should be on the top I think. Right corner, yes. uh the text? Yeah. Uh yeah, at the back? Well you c Well uh Yes. You can The logo can be on on every uh front. Yeah, but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something. Yeah, on the backside. Well n n not not on the front side, I think. On the back Yes, you you can, yeah, push that in, so that it is always be there. Yeah. Yeah I think over here the logo. Yes we could No, they have two fronts, that. You you can Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, you can you can just And then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something. This is titanium. And this is uh F front. Yeah. With the with the curved edge. Yeah. Yeah. Tada. Yeah. Ah. Yeah, that's nice finishing touch you need. Yeah, this is the front. This is the My design. Yeah. We'll stay here I guess? Well we can uh erase an animal I guess. Uh the fourth one. Uh the fourth one is empty, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I think we have to wait? Maybe. Yeah. Aha. This has no function. We've done too much in the previous meetings. Yes, we've got nothing to do now. Its the best remote ever. Pinball. Yes, but you you get really close to the screen with your hand, and I don't think that's Hmm. We can better uh draw a design on this. Yeah, but we can't. Well We'll stay here? Or we'll get the email. Yeah. Well we'll wait a few seconds and then we'll get an email. Yeah.
Speaker D: I'm listening. Right. Great. Alright, great. Yeah, great. Alright, Trendwatch. Right. I will speak about uh latest trends trends, latest fashion updates, and uh things we must not do. Uh the trends. It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling. Uh this because of our last model was very functional, but it uh people didn't like that, so our new mo model must be very good-looking. That's uh something you uh have to take a look at. And uh the feeling has to be very great. Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great. Um there's a minus uh two times here, because this is the most important point. This is uh two times as less important, and uh same for this one. Um, technological technological innovations, that's uh regarded very highly too. Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen, uh speech uh acknowledgement, as we uh talked about earlier. So we have to have uh something like that, like we uh Right. Uh the last point is easy to use. Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself. I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that. Yeah? Yeah, I know. I think we have to go for the first one. It's the most important one. So we have to uh take that one. So it it it isn't very important that that it works easy. But it has to look great. We'll see. Yeah, right. But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow, that's real great uh great concept. Alright. Uh these are the new colours of this year. So it must be very bright, very colourful. People like this. So we we have to think uh in this direction. So i set your mind to it. Findings? Fashion update? Fruit and vegetables are cool. I am told. The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables. So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way. Uh furthermore uh material, that's your part, should be very strong. I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it, maybe in a colour or something, that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong. And that's uh also for the younger public. Yeah, that's great. But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin. So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily. Well, the don'ts. Older people like dark colours and simple shapes. Well we don't want uh older people, we want young people. So uh we're gonna turn that around. We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours. Right? Okay. We don't want wood. Old people. So, that's it for me. Yeah, we should change that. No no no. Mm. Yeah. We keep coming back to the fronts. Yeah. Fruity. Fruity. Well it's got a strong look, this. Yeah. Yeah, it still has a strong look. But then you are losing your fruity colours. That's true. Yeah but the But it doesn't have to look strong. The the results are, the feel of the material is expected to be strongy. The feel. Nah yeah the feel Right. I agree. I dunno. Yeah right. Yeah. Right. Oh okay. Right. No. But that that makes it cheap. It's it's just a an extra function, and it's cheap. No but Yeah, right. Young people love them. Yeah, ple Right. Alright. How How How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen? Alright. So you have a menu button, and then you can go up and down. Yeah right. Yeah.. You have to push hard. Yeah. Yeah. You've Right. And you you need a you need a speaker. For the Yeah. Yeah. Exit. But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part. Or don't Right, and spea speaker at the back, or something. Alright. Alright. Yeah, fine. Move on. Yeah. Nei They're n they're not trendy. It doesn't look strong. Yeah right. This is just crazy. Nah th It's too expensive. Yeah. But are we going for a strange uh form? 'Cause people like that. Not too strange. You can make the the underside, you can make it more round, where the L_C_D_ is. I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone, with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms, s something like that. You know? Yeah, but people like something uh new you know. Yeah, different. Y yis Alright. Great. Your bag. Yeah. Materials are the most, most impor Yeah. Do you know the new uh No no The front is the most important. But the feel of plastic isn't strong. Yeah alright, alright. 'Kay. Yeah. Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas Yeah, but it it's expensive. Bendable. Bendable. Yeah. Paint spray. Yeah alright. So, we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front? Yeah, great. Yeah. But then you have the problem, when you have a titanium back, you can't switch it. When you want an other colour on the front, it doesn't match. You know? I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Alright. Funky customers. Alright. Nei. So external. Yeah. Alright. I think we can launch a couple of packages. You can buy a different kind of of of machine, but it's the same thing, but with another front. So And you can you can Yeah right. Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini Yeah. It's good marketing. Yeah, n not too heavy. You can always take another pick. They have to buy it later on. Yeah right. More basic. Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing. Else it w won't sell. So Lost my mouse. Unbelievable. Yeah. Yeah togeth You can take the SMARTboard. Have fun. 'Kay. We don't have produ product yet, so kind of difficult. Ajax. Nah. Um round. Yeah. Round. Curvy. Yeah. So you can see you have to up or down. And this must be uh volume I think, and this programme. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I noticed. You can't uh click the corners. It's a real real great thing. Let's start the design. O Yeah. Me too. But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts. So Yeah, right. The logo Yeah. But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable, when you get off the front. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but you can scratch it off or something. It's better if you have it uh Yeah. I agree. But not too big. Just uh Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No no no no. You have to make this titanium too. Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_. Like dust in it and so things like that. When you exchange all the fronts and it's open. Yeah. Some some kind of wei weight in it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is. Because it has to be uh there all the time you know. So uh a little corner of titanium. So this this is the exchangeable part. Right. Taking all the credit. But there's a problem. We can't uh take a blank one. Or can we? Yeah. Nah that's alright, that's alright. This one is empty. You have to empty one huh? Alright. No Yeah. Yeah. It's not relaxing. I I don't have a laptop. Yeah right. Dream on. Half No. It's all about cool things. And it will sell. We will be rich. No. No man. You just have to push harder. Yeah. Mm. Recalibrate it. Yeah. Finish meeting now. Yeah. Oh. Alright. Have fun lads.","We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Alright , Trendwatch . It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too . Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier . Uh the last point is easy to use . Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . Well we have to choose one of them . Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . So it must be very bright , very colourful . Fruit and vegetables are cool . Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , And also they like curved round shapes . Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . So it it looks pretty but it feels strong . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , Um it's not really speech recognition , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . No it doesn't does not do anything . Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . But then we should also have an uh an Okay button . I suggest a banana shape . m Next year that's out . Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? Um the video button should be uh an apart button , But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out . if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy . This is my suggested design . Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . Yeah , fine . I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but Nah th It's too expensive . Alright . You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is . So it f falls over the hand . I will design it , we design it later . Well a case ? Uh that's me . Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , And then the front is made of plastic . And you can put that on and off , But the feel of plastic isn't strong . Titanium back , plastic front . Okay . but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work . Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera . Um well we have our beautiful drawing . Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder , and then I'll put it in our end report . We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot . Yeah I think we can launch a couple of packages . Launch different lines at once . Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so , and that they want more . Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh well introduce our remote . Maybe a a cheap voice recording . We all agree on that . Yeah . Industry designer , . User Interface , Mike . You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , but uh you'll get uh the specifications . Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? Yeah . Round . Well yeah . Um I think um a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be Uh I I'd say only the logo . Well , our slogan is not very long . But you can put it on the back , Right corner , yes . Ah the logo should be on the top I think . But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . The logo can be on on every uh front . Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front So uh a little corner of titanium . Yes , that also sounds uh pretty uh neat . I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it , Yeah , that's great . uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , Can you draw it now ? When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match ."
109,"Speaker A: Mm. Well, yeah. No. Oh. We have forty minutes for this uh discussion? Alright. Huh? Yeah. Mm-hmm, now it's right. It's meant to be easily wiped out, yeah. Mm-hmm. I I disagree, but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess. Oh, alright. Yeah, we are a real fashionable company. I read uh I read it on the I didn't know what company we were, but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff. So it has to be uh a modern design. That's important to know, uh when you design a thing of course. Yeah. The order? No. You can zap away. Yeah. Oh. Oh? Mm-hmm. I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote, of course. Uh I didn't read it? Oh, alright. users to uh add one? Do you think? Mm-hmm. Yeah alright. Because they don't use it? Alright. Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it? Isn't it part of the of the u No. No. Never mind. Consider the m Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's going to be expensive. Yeah. Well we'll uh consider it uh. We'll think abo we'll think No, we'll look we'll look into that later. Alright? We have very demanding clients. Yeah, yeah, alright. Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find, I think. We don't rule them out uh yet. Shall I give a technical talk? Alright. Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design. We have that here. Okay, how do you enlarge it, so that you can have the F_ F_ five. Yep. Well, the working design, that's my uh Well alright uh, you know who I am and what I do. So uh we have this. It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something. It was originally in black and white but it became black and purple. But I think you can read it. Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control. Uh well you can see uh And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page. Well, you can read it, it's not too difficult. Meanwhile, this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works. You have uh basically uh the energy, the power of the of the remote control, uh and the sender, w which is the LED, the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the, no, to the set. And uh the source is of course the user. Uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course. And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip, and the chip uh sends it to the LED, and the LED sends it to the receiver. That's the that's the basic idea. Very basic. Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps. Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key. It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed. The key a signal to a chip, uh the chip senses the connection. uh and recognise the key. So well you understand. The chip uh produces Morse code, um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed, of course. And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED, which is the bulb, of course. Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the, well it's uh very simple, and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set, and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the the signal, and performs the assigned task. Ah bu Yeah, but we don't. Uh we No no, but Yeah. Exactly. Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote. I've some couple of pictures here. It's a very basic one. And uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it, it uh won't look anything like this, but This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control. It has uh very little buttons and But it it uh it's it's quite um Yeah, you can easily recognise the buttons. They're uh far enough apart and an anything. It's not very um uh not very high-tech uh indeed, and it's not very user-friendly. Uh if you look at the shape, it's uh just a simple long box uh shape. So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that, uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly, and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately You don't have to look and and search for them. Well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb, of course. Yeah. Well,. But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed, and as you say at the thumb. I think that's a good idea, and uh and that the less important uh buttons, like the the the different channels, uh the numbers one two three four five as well, should be uh yeah well not in reach, because uh they don't use it uh all the time. Well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said. And I have some pictures of the inside workings, but uh I don't want to get too technical, because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you. So yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside. And uh well that's about it I think. Oh yeah, I still have this. Oh I had to delete this, but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new But I had too too little time, but uh don't uh don't look at it please. I I think it's it's clear uh how it works. Alright. That's the most important thing. Alright. Uh Right. Yeah, uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages, with different links. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You can't really see uh the differ from different sides. But I think uh Uh you can draw it if you Yeah. We can put it on the on the back side. Yeah, so that you don't replace the symbol, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mike, uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file? In Map? The younger uh Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh No um mm usually But Yeah I think m most Most uh Mm-hmm. Uh. Yeah. Our competitor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have, uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen. But should it uh really be uh clickable, uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy. But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design, with the scrolling text and that kind of thing. Alright. Shouldn't we start with the most important parts? The L_C_D_ screen alright but we should start with the power button? Uh Huh? And then uh Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here. I dunno what uh you were talking about but we are busy with something. Uh-huh. Why do you think it's better at the bottom? But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down, so that there's room for the for the interface. Uh-huh. And and we can Bottom. Well that's a bit exaggerated. Well, I agree with you. It's it's also more recognisable. It looks more like a calculator to people, if you have the l the the the thing on top. Yeah w well, but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away, uh because I think it's uh I think it's still important to have it at the top, because it's uh it's more familiar that way. A little a little bit. Maybe you should another pen. Maybe that's uh better. You e you only have one pen for that screen. Yeah. Yeah. I I agree. Well I'm the I I'm the designer, so um Yeah. Uh we uh we were busy with that. Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing. So, we have the power button. Yeah of course. Uh it's uh. Yeah. W wh While you have to agree, I can say it's like this and you must agree. Yeah. Channel, yeah. Volume control. Um Well let's look at your uh design. Uh Uh-huh. Yeah. But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else, a D_V_D_ player or something. So Yeah, it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand. Y Yeah. It's good to move uh from time to time. Yeah. No but now y W would we have to choose a way in middle? Mm-hmm. Oh. Far apart? I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together, but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together. Yeah. C c can you make you make We can use uh the drawing board now, I think. Uh it it doesn't work well but But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing. Mm. Alright. Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top, so Yeah. You say familiarity isn't important but Yeah d Yeah. As we we we we agreed, we do have a L_C_D_. So that's that's enough. Yeah. There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero. Oh, like that. Um They'd recognise it. Th that's the most That that's very easy. Yeah. I think these are the the most important functions. basic function. Oh yeah. Uh just two just two under uh under uh I I think uh But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section. Uh that's that's too complicated. You can just put it somewhere They they aren't used much, not as much as those other, so you can put it somewhere Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom. Yeah. Yeah or at the top, yeah. What do you think uh those those buttons? Above or down? And w where? Well we design it later. We have it, and we design later where everything goes. Yeah. The the video channel uh? No no not always. Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel. But it's easy to go If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel, you do you have to push a to to get below zero. It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button. Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah, sk Yeah y you you you you have screen width. Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah. Yeah. You should Yeah. I think that's important. Uh And and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast. Channel, yeah. Chief? Chief? Th the menu menu button is also important. Then you can uh Where? I don't see it. Oh Menu, alright. In the menu. And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something. Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu. Yeah. Or the volume, yeah. Yes chief. Yeah this is this is your thing. I am hungry. See you later mate.
Speaker B: Great man. Who starts? Alright, great. Alright. Mm-hmm. Yes. 'Kay. Yeah. No. You're the only one. Alright. 'Kay. Alright. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Alright. Yeah. But let's forget about it. It's just time-consuming, so we uh have to go on. Yes. Mm. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think I have to start. Oh no, no problem. I I just have to uh to think which file's mine, 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry. I think it's this one. But I'm not sure. Hmm? Yeah. S Right. Yes. This is it. Well, I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements. Um to start with these points. Uh next sheet? Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls, because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things. Uh, furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use. Um then I tell something about um the most important issues. So we have to focus on those three thing three things. And in the end I'll um show you our target audience or our target product users, customers. Well, um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly. That's seventy five per cent of the current users. They don't like it, so we might think about fronts in that section. Um They also say, that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent, uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls. So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control. Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions. Uh, almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity. So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy. Furthermore, it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot. Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle, so you can reach it with your thumb. Yeah, yeah right. Right. A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room. So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television, that's your um your control beeps or something, that you can find this very easily. I dunno, maybe that's an idea. 'Cause it's uh a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control, within the same room. So Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device? Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something? Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room. So Well a beeping device would be Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem. Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn. So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it. Yeah but people don't read manuals. No. I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use, than a manual. Yeah. Right. And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes. Alright. And we don't have much time. So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design. So you can pick up and use it, than I think. Yeah right, right. Next point. Um R_S_I_. Well that's about twenty per cent I thought. But uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh Wie zeg ik dat? Yeah, consider the consequences of using your remote. It should be a good in your hand. Right, this is the most important part. Um, we're Like the requirements said, we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience. Um, that's about sixty per cent of the market, so it's uh quite important. Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device. Uh I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty, ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that. So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs. Yeah but they think it's really important. So if we want to s If we have a big If we make lots of uh of the stuff, maybe we can uh buy it very cheap, I dunno. We have to uh Yeah, I don't know. I don't have any information on that. So Right. And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition. They also like that, but research is very uh costly. So Yeah, but it it might be important for the sale. Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition. So we might consider L_C_D_ screens. Alright. Alright. Um, I think that's it. Um I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes. So you can Right. Yeah. Right. Alright. Next button. Oh right. Purple. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A bit. Maybe you can select it. So it uh inverts. the p the whole picture. Nah, uh never mind. Yeah. Alright. Right. Can I say something? Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons. Uh the power button is used very much, channel selection, volume and teletext. Well teletext is not an option, so that uh But I think it's very important to make um the power, channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb, so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences. Right. Make them big, make them easy to uh to press. Right. Yeah, right. Right. Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right. We But Yeah. That's very important. And But is that is that useable? Do people, uh when they pick up a remote, know that they have to do that? It's a f it's a new feature, you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it. Yeah, he feels it immediately. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Right, continue. Sorry. Yeah, that's right. Alright. Alright. Yeah, it's clear. I dunno. I think uh w About twenty minutes ago? Losing time losing time. Yeah right. So I don't think so. Yeah right. These are already in use? Alright, okay. Well Yeah, me too. Mm. But we have to reject that, because of the requirements? Alright. Yeah, right. Yeah. But it Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's a must. We must have that. We can make a symbol of the company right here. And if you put a front on it, there's a hole on the front. So the symbol's always on Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But let's not focus on the front. Alright. Yeah, I agree. I've I've got another point. Um there are two target audi audiences, and we've uh chose for the younger one. Um, research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features. They are high high interested in feature. But they are more critical. Fo Yeah, critical. So The younger audience. So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people. Mm-hmm. Clip aren't used much. Yeah right. Yeah but Yeah. Here, look at these numbers. The newest features are, like I said, are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control. Our audience, these people, are very like these uh features. You see? So we must build in something, or they will to uh go to the concurrent. The concurrent? Competitors, right. So, I do think we have to uh have some features. Even though they cost a little more. Right. Right. Like a ticker-tape. Which programme you are l watching or something. Yeah, right. Yeah right. No not clickable. Nah, no no no. Yeah, just at at the top. So when you s you sit like this you can can watch. I think it should be at the top. Yeah right. It's a ticker-tape idea. Well it's just one script. Yeah, five minutes of ja ja for programming. So I don't think that's the issue. Alright, we go with the L_C_D_ screen? 'Kay. Right, I don't know if I can find that, but Next time. Yeah right. Yeah, I understand what you're saying. We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look. Right. At the top. I think the top is more uh When you s How do you zap? You just sit in your chair? With the remote? Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be. Yeah, I dunno. We'll draw two, and then we'll see uh No Um he thinks Yeah, right. He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom, and I think it's better at the top. But your Yeah. The the ticker The L_C_D_ is like like small. It's it's wide. It's not not high. But Yeah right. But We're making a remote with with a few functions you know. We High-tech. Width. Th that's not a problem. When I draw here it Oh. Huh? Yeah, it's off. It it needs to be calibrated again. Well Where? Alright, we have to make a decision now, because we don't have much time. Um I think we have uh a few functions, and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it, and still have lots of room at the bottom, where you can put your hand. At the bot So We are two uh V_S_ two. Right. Great. And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s. It's uh your it's your job. Yeah, right. Alright, let's keep it central. Mm. Right. You should put that uh power button, channel and volume should have the most uh importance. Yeah, but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true. When when you uh put them all in the same place, the most used buttons, you're doing the same thing all the time, and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about. So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other. Um Frequency of uh button use. Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour. You can see. So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart, I think, up and down. You thinking uh about R_S_I_? Y look at uh look at the frequency. Nei not too much, but Nei nei nei n I I totally agree. But just Yeah. Right. Yeah. I agree. And should and should be red. Right, just make some decisions. The most important things we have to uh I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now. Just uh you decide that, you decide that, and ready. Yeah. Nei. We're No We're deciding now, so Top or bottom? Okay. Yeah, right. Okay. Yeah, okay. No. Do you still have the pictures over there? Yeah, that's about it. You do need the uh multi Or did uh No, like this one. You do need them? Yeah, I know. But are we Alright, alright uh Now okay. Right. Yeah, it's most useable this way. Yeah. Right. I do think we have to put that underneath a clip. Yeah. Okay, right. Well if you you take those th If you Yeah, but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh Yeah, but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_. Ah uh well whatever,. Yeah, but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons, you have to have uh channel setting, if you wa if you have a new T_V_. You have to set the channels. Right all th these uh different buttons you have to Ah, I do. Right. That's the only one we put uh in there. For a screen uh fu uh channel setting. Programme, right. Uh Ah. Great. Alright. Ah. Okay. Get into my belly.
Speaker C: Mm. Oh. Oh. Oh, that's a shame. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. No. I don't think Yeah. Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work. Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control, I think. Yeah right. It sh it should be there, the manual. But but not to explain how the remote works. Only Hmm. No. I think that's uh difficult to realise also. No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think. Yeah. No. Oh you go. Yeah, go ahead. High tech. You can also like Yeah, I was thinking you can Are some of the the the um Maybe you can make, for for channel changing, two little buttons on the side of the remote, so you can just do like this. Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Hmm? Well Yeah alright, but Yeah, but if you s say them up and down, they they'll understand it, I think. Eighty per cent would. Yeah that's true. Yeah but Mm. Well I thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing, but obviously that's not the case. Yeah. For instance you couldn't see this. Um Yeah. Well I'm Mike, User Interface Designer. The the method? Well I used my own experience with remotes, took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website, which are these two. Um Yes, these are from from another uh manufacturer. Um This one is engineering-centred, so this one has the most functions and um things. This one is user-centred. Um I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best. Um Well, I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also, and teletext and that kind of stuff. Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one. But Yes. Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel. Um I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need. I um I kinda like the shape. I think this is what we talked about. But No I've Well I showed it somewhere. Um Oh yeah. I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front. So we can can uh yeah customise the Mm? Yeah. It's a front. It's not the the whole remote that changes, of course. You can Mm. Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote. So l like Ericsson does every uh S something like this. It's recognisable. Um Yeah? Yeah yeah. Something like that, in the Yeah. Yeah. Um Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function. If we we had to include more functions. But we don't. So um Yeah. I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need. Maybe some less. Like eject we don't need, and some other buttons we don't need. I think uh Yeah, I will. I think uh for the remote um uh less is more. The less buttons the better the design. Um We should go with that concept I think. I know. Mm. Yeah, but what kind of features? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition. But I've Yeah, that's nice. Yeah, we should keep that simple too. It will No, it should be uh integrated. I think Yeah, something like on um some radios in car. You Where it's, yeah, walking to Yeah. Wa Yeah. Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost. Or maybe you will get that information uh Yeah. At the top or at the bottom? Yeah but Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural. 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom. Yeah, no Mm. Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom, and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody. I c Well I d I think that's that's ugly but I th Yeah. Power button always Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, y you gotta zap like this or you want to Yeah. Yeah you don't want You want uh Yeah it it it must be a remote. Yeah. At the bottom? In a few minutes Oh yeah, oh yeah, I totally agree. Yeah. He's the boss. No it's our job. For all of us I think. The ten numbers? Yeah? Volume? I think we we should use something like this um to um The the channel up and channel down button? Yeah, in circle, you know? And and a volume control also in it. Yes, as I already said, we could drop some of these buttons. Yeah. I think these should be in one big circle in the middle. Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place. They they need to be centred. Volume hardly. No I don't think. Yeah but Yeah but No. The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important. So Well they are used four times an hour, so Power bu button should be left at the top. Mm. Yeah. Well consensus, um We we can put it in the middle, so Alright. No. Well just when you push a one one and No, if you On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other, d it Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here. Or at Yeah alright then. Oh, they can be small or round like buttons. Why go to video? That's just zero. Yeah. Yeah, but you can can zap down Yes, I think th No, then you press ninety nine. I think go to video is an irrelevant button, but Yeah well y you must have. Yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something, and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh Yeah, alright. I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu, yeah. Yeah, the Or the volume or something like that. Your pen. I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now, or not? Yeah, lunch break.
Speaker D: Well I'll uh start just with another presentation, so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting. Okay. I've put some uh new things in the in the map. Uh oh. This is it. I don't know the shortcut, so Ah F_ five. Well our functional design meeting, that's the stage we're in. And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it. Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting, what we uh thought we had dec decided. But uh Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you. I think you have prepared uh all three uh? Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh I dunno. Y you also have uh received that mail, the new project requirements from our bosses? Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements, and I'll have a look if Well I think we should show them before your presentations, because it's not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't, because of the new requirements. Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions. We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be. And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely. Uh Uh yeah, I think so. Well uh the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet. Um now I'll look at show this board. Um Well uh notes, first meeting. Now. I gave a disc a a presentation. Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas. So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors, and uh look at their uh remote controls. We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have, our technical releases. Uh not too many one buttons. One recognisable button in the middle, where you do the most important functions with. And um well they can have two functions, because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television. Um the design has to fit the hand, be original, but also be familiar. It's uh one of our ideas. Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago, so it's not quite uh But well I have to do it. The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from, and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible. It should be uh recognisable at all times. Yes. Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones. And uh the technical aspects um And also labelling of the buttons, the functions should be universal standards. Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting. It's quite logical al all of it. Um now the new project requirements, I'll just show them. I got this mail from uh our bosses. Well, teletext goes out. We will not use teletext. Maybe a new sort of thing, but n but not teletext. Well the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ and they don't want it, because of our time we have for this project. So that's a shame, because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years. Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point. Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it. Yeah. Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products. So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan, maybe a colour, and um Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh, well as we already said a actually, uh familiar. Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yes. I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have, our company. It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics. So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something. Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations. You want to start? Oh you have to start? I didn't see anything about uh who had to start. Well s then start. Okay. Well uh You already uh opened uh PowerPoint. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well It should actually uh It should actually be loose from the television, because it can also be used for other televisions. So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television, that bleeps to your remote control, everyone can use it. No you can click it on your television. Yeah in another room, yeah. Well yes. Yeah. Well we'll have a look at it, yeah. Yep. Well there sh should always be a menu, but it c can be very short. Yes okay. Well we are a design team, we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point. So Well we'll have a look. Um yes? Yep. Well Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost, we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh Yeah. Well Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh Nigh I know. It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so We sh Yeah absolutely. Yep. 'Kay. Alright. Yes. Well you I c I can uh still see your presentation. It's in the Well uh next um I dunno who is next. You uh got uh Yes. Well go ahead. Yip. F_ five. F_ five. Click. Yep. Yeah. So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that. And a button for T_V_. So Well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place, and you keep making the same um well moves. But if y if you would put it at a different place, then you have to move your hands, and that's on of the things about R_S_I_. No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_. Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons. Well it it's Well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote Yeah. If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote, and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel. That's very irritating, I think. Well. No. Yep. Mm-hmm. That's your part of the job. Yep. Okay. Well we understand. We understand. Oh right, no. Nice. Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation. How late is did we start his presentation uh? Wha Yeah. Well then we have still the time, so But we do have to come to a decision, right later on. So Oh yeah? Uh? Okay, yeah well. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I like user-centred. Yeah. We also do that. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well absolutely, but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company. So we cannot just uh make someone w No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front. So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it, then uh our recognition is totally gone. Yeah, we must. Yeah well and and Yes. 'Kay. Yeah yeah yeah. Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front. Those kind of things. Yes. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Alright. Yeah? Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top, and the bottom side of the front has a little clip, a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do. Well but because you say they their features are important, they want m um a lot, but not Yeah. Competitors. Yeah. Well maybe w we could uh s On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something, or that you can click uh out uh of the remote. And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information. Yeah. Those kind of things, uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s. And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also, you they can display which programme you're currently watching. Yeah. For example. It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it. Yeah. Well maybe. Yeah. Yeah. R_D_S_s or something. Well I think it's you got It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling, and it's not uh That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh Yeah. No. Uh well I think so, yes. Um We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that. Um we can use this board again, I think. Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want, th the issue. Where is my presentation? Uh Uh Well I mean we're all here now, I think. These I've already given you. So we have to decide on the different remote control functions. So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special. Yes. Yeah. That thing is terrible. Uh Well Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point, because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom. So and and I I like to use the ones on the top. So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window Yes but we we we we don't want that. We don't want them to look like a calculator. We want to look it like our original but familiar Yea Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh We White? Width. Uh format yeah format? Line width? Width? Yeah? It's a bit off. Well. Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh It's special pen. Yeah. No. I think it should be at the button, bottom. Bottom. The L_C_D_. Yeah. Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions, and then look at the design. Because we have to decide this. Yeah. Yes. Well we have a power button. Guys? Guys? We have a power button, setting buttons, L_C_D_ window, the number buttons Uh Yes. Uh the mute button. I h love that one. Yes. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Well that's that's also design. Yes. Um Well h ho Yes. Yes. They are for some uh video uh Apart. So people have to move their hand. And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_. That's what I always do, because all my i important buttons are the same place. Yes? Well not Yes. Uh-huh. Up and down far apart from each other? Well not too much. Well for example the power button, you can If someone is constantly z zapping, it's not going to miss, that it that the power button is not right beside it. Because I have someone But the buttons is way. So that one can be put away. The power button can uh be uh uh Yes. Oh man, five minutes. Yeah, well five minutes left. Yep. Um how are we going to do it with those numbers? Well I have it here. Yeah well that's going to take too too much time. Yes. Yes. Well the L_C_D_. Um you are Industrial, you are User Interface. So I think it's going to go to Mike. But you will have to make consensus with. Well Well it's a bit hard, because we are going to be uh individually. That's a bit uh Yes. Yes it is. Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions, and the design comes into the next round? Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh? Alright these functions. The number f Well yes, that's alright. W the number function. Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital? How do you want it to do then? It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more. Yes. Alright so no button for that. Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote? So No, we'd uh just said we didn't uh Well uh Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes, all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant. So just for a television is that all we need? Teletext is gone. So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext Oh screen placing. We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting. Uh there's um screen. You can make it wider and less wide. And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video. Those two? But it's just two, and we make a clip? Th that's a bit uh waste. Yes. Or at the top. Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go. Yes. Yeah Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote. Yes? Yes. Yes. Well any other uh Go to video, that's always on your remote control. To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_. Well l n no not at not at my remote. Yeah. Yes. I don't. I go to ninety-nine. Th that's the button uh No. No you can ch push zero. Yeah. Yeah, I I think that one button is uh I use it uh Yeah? These buttons, I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote. It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down, uh those So we still have one uh four? Ch ch Okay. Oh the Okay button? Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button, for your menu. Menu button. Channel, setting, menu. We have to go. Okay. So um Save. Yes see. Yes I have put it in. Here. Alright. Guys? We're going to uh go to our uh rooms, and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think. So Well see you uh W w we have lunchtime, by the way, now uh so uh Lunch. Ah. We didn't exactly do everything but So","Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . Well , teletext goes out . I I disagree , because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ and they don't want it , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . Well , um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . Furthermore , it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room . So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think . It sh it should be there , the manual . Next point . Um R_S_I_ . Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . Uh I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . It's going to be expensive . Yeah . I don't have any information on that . So No , we'll look we'll look into that later . And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They also like that , I think that's uh difficult to realise also . We don't rule them out uh yet . Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , I've some couple of pictures here . It has uh very little buttons and High tech . and it's not very user-friendly . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . That's very irritating , I think . But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , And I have some pictures of the inside workings , Yeah . Well I'm Mike , User Interface Designer . took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . Um This one is engineering-centred , I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best . I um I kinda like the shape . I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need . I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone . Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . We can put it on the on the back side . And if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on We can make a symbol of the company right here . Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ? Yeah , I will . and we've uh chose for the younger one . Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . but what kind of features ? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . Which programme you are l watching or something . So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , I think it should be at the top . Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? Uh well I think so , yes . Um Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . No but we're we'll have to look into that . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . We don't want them to look like a calculator . I think it's still important to have it at the top , because it's uh it's more familiar that way . I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons Channel , yeah . Volume control . Uh the mute button . I think we we should use something like this um to um The the channel up and channel down button ? Yeah , in circle , you know ? And and a volume control also in it . You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance . I think these should be in one big circle in the middle . Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true . So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . No I don't think . I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . Right , just make some decisions . Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , d it Alright so no button for that . Uh there's um screen . You can make it wider and less wide . I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . Th that's a bit uh waste . You can just put it somewhere Oh , they can be small or round like buttons . Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah . Why go to video ? Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh So we still have one uh four ? For a screen uh fu uh channel setting . Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . Yeah , alright . Menu button . Yeah . I think that's important . I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than I think . The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . No not clickable . But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video ."
47,"Speaker A: I dunno. Throwing away my toothpick. 'Kay. Nice user interface. 'Kay. Right let's see it. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Alright, your favourite animal? Grizzly bear. Yeah. We're kinda losing time, though. We're losing time, but Alright. Do we have to guess? A hippo? Yeah. I don't know how to call it. A hedgehog?. Alright. Thank you. It's. Yeah sure. It's a rabbit. Well Looks very nice, right? Yes. Yes uh right. You go man. Alright. I should have made mine a white rabbit.. You're standing in front of it, I can't see it. Alright, thank you. Yeah it's a bird, but what kind of bird? You have to push harder. Release your anger. Hmm. It's a cat. It's a pig. Right. No it looks great. Just save it. Oh great. It's good for group spirit. Right. Right. I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors. Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control. On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce. Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control. Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world, for different cultures, maybe, because we want to we want to well fifty million? Yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it. So Yeah. Yeah that's right. Mm-hmm. Right. Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something. Yeah right. Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that. Yeah but We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh Yeah but it's it has to be useable. Yeah. No.. Not with two hands. Yeah yeah yeah, right. No Yeah but it's quite important that it fits. Yeah. Yeah. It shouldn't be boxy. Nah I don't agree with the long box uh shape it it has to be custom made for the hand. Yeah. Yeah but if you shape it If No that's ol old fashioned. I can imagine that us Well Yeah right. It fits in your palms. Hmm? Um.. Well Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand. It shouldn't be too boxy, you know. It's No no no. Yeah. Yeah it should be Right maybe something like this or and then a button here to switch between different systems like D_V_D_ player and so you can I've Yeah right, and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and Right. But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button. So there has to be some space between the buttons. Yeah. Yeah right right, and maybe we should use colours. Yeah. That's kinda trendy. Yeah right. Right. But I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make, so we Yeah. No problem. Yeah. Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah. Yep. And you can use Yeah. But are Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea? I think we should make it universal and you can always use a front front on it, you know? You can use it just plain but you can To make it more trendy. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah right. Yeah yeah yeah. But people of often don't like bright colours or something. We have to make it grey or s or black. Yeah but then you can use a a front. Yeah that's right. Yeah or a t Teletubby front. Yeah yeah yeah. I will investigate. Right. It's Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer Yeah. Well that's great. Thirty minutes. It's totally broken. Oh.
Speaker B: Mm-hmm. Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh Does it? Yeah. It works. Wonderful. Mm-hmm.. Alright, yep. I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment. I I I I understand. Alright. so start Yep yes. Don't uh count on it. I think it's a mouse or a rat. Oh. Oh I know it. It's a hedgehog. Well I'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills. Yeah. I am the Industrial Designer. Chief, I am the Industrial Designer. Yeah. I think It's pr it resembles the animal drawn by. I think can I say it? It looks amazing. These are very impor These are very important documents, of course, uh these drawings, uh And he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the English word for. It looks like an uh It looks like that beast from Sesame Street. Yeah. It's it's uh Do we have to uh But we have uh do we have to name the specific species of the bird? No? Well wonderful. Why do I have to do the difficult tasks? Uh pen yeah that's. Uh current colour. I like uh oh they don't have pink. Oh b oh think this is uh Uh? Uh Line width. Uh fifteen. And I can draw? Uh Oh the line width is too thick, but oh well. Uh. It smiles nicely. Now I have to change the line width. Uh one. These are whiskers, you know. Uh well I think it's obvious right now. Miaow. Well if this isn't obvious I'll save it alright uh save. Uh yeah uh blank. Well I feel comfortable now. Thanks for this exercise. I feel totally at ease. Yeah something like that. So Alright. Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh it's not, it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls, but uh Mm-hmm. No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh and numbers and uh that every culture in uh, yeah, people in every country can recognise. Alright. Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh And stereo uh s uh audio installations. Most people do, yeah. It doesn't it doesn't have to be Yeah. Well. Hmm. It has to be different and familiar at the same time. yeah the shape will will have to be recognised. I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped, but that's not uh very recognisable. Oval? I Mm. Oh but it ha it has to be m yeah. But you still have to know it's a remote and not another Yeah. Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh, yeah, useful or else uh they would have been ano another shape. Yeah. Yeah a lo the long box shape yeah. You have to use one hand. Why not? But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this, and you can make it another shape, but then you have W no w what else? I di Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then? Hmm. Well but it's still then uh the the long box, uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand, but it's it's still Yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still sort of box, yeah. It it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box, so that's what I mean. Yeah yeah I understand, but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course, but in in in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh to fit. Yeah yes I thought about something like that. Yeah. A big recognisable button on top or something. The buttons should uh also be not too small, not too big, of course, and uh n uh uh not too close uh together. Uh-huh. Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions. Yeah. Colours, yeah. I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um. Already thought about something tha Mm-hmm. Yeah now we can still talk about the material, we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course, hard plastic, the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh. No n n Mm. Alright. And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other. I think so. It's a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam I think. It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things. And have well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works. The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly, but that's pretty obvious, I think. Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something uh b a simple colour not not very flashy. Pink television sets pink remote,. Alright. I must not forget my pen the next time. Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task, yeah. Yeah I uh w was wondering that too. Y you went to the company website. It's the the the start uh starting page uh Very handy to know. Right see you in half an hour then. W Right uh see you in thirty minutes then.
Speaker C: Hi there. We want to erase it. Thanks. Big bird. Mm. Uh no I don't. It's just a bird. Here you go. Mm. Width. Hmm. It's a pussy cat. It certainly is. Easy to learn. Yeah. Yeah. I also think we should not add too many buttons. Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think. Precisely. Yeah. Yeah indeed. Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use, we uh we make? Yeah. And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes. So we can keep that in mind. W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it. Yeah alright, but Yeah. Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour, that kind of things. Well we we could make more more oval or something, and and Yeah or so Well yeah it's new. but young people want something different and it is Yeah. Yeah alright. Yeah. Yeah it doesn't fit. No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped. They're all um Well Yeah. Yes uh Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end, and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end. Mm. Yeah it Yeah yea Hmm.. Yeah. Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them, and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs I dunno but Well. Mm... Yeah that's bad, yeah. Yeah that's important. Yeah. But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country, so. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Mm. Well you can make profit with them, and it's a way to make them trendy. Yeah alright. Yeah normal. No a colour everyone accepts. Mm. Mm. Yeah. standard. Well young people s li Yeah yeah, yeah. Yeah. What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't get Yeah. Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it. Yes. Next meeting is in Thirty minutes. Yeah alright it's it's handy to know Oh. Goodbye. S.
Speaker D: Yo. Ow. Uh Yeah. What the Uh Yeah well, ja well let's just start. I've uh made a presentation uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard, so we can all see it. So it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here. Well. Very nice. Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting. So uh I'm the Project Manager, so I had to fill it in, and uh hmm. Oh sorry. And an uh a nice agenda. Uh we'll do the opening and then uh we'll meet each other, what uh we already do, so, that's not uh very much trouble. I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here, so that we can all use them. Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction. We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project, and then uh we'll close the meeting, and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here. So this the opening we'll uh We have to uh design a new television remote control. You have heard that uh already I think, so. Um we want it to be original, so a nice uh a nice new design. Uh trendy, it's also for young people, and we have to just uh make it uh modern. And uh friendly, so size does matter. And uh Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place, that kin those kind of things. Other uh There happen to be uh three stages. functional, conceptual, and d detailed design. Um so every time we we'll do some individual work, get meeting, talk about it, uh and then go into the next phase. That's just it. Um We have uh these two Smartboards. Um well as I just showed, there's a project management folder, a project document folder on the desktop. It just works exactly the same as a computer. You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop. So you can uh make uh Words Excel, everything. Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things, you can uh draw. This is a uh well a drawing board. you have a these different uh functions on the board. You can see them there. So you have a a nice pen, and it's works just like a bal ball pen. This is just a. I want to uh Oh yeah. Of course w doesn't work any more. Yes I will eraser so. It's fantas fantastic. We can uh uh well you can save a file. So if uh we draw we have to save everything. Don't throw anything away. Uh just we can start a new one, and we just go on, and don't throw anything away. Just uh let them all uh stand here. We can delete, but we don't do that. Um you can here select a pen, you can draw anything you want. It's a bit uh childish you have to write. It's not as fast as you w you know it, but it does work sometimes. Well it's just like a normal uh paint. So it's gone. Well we are designers, so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard. So that's fantastic. Um well this uh speaks for itself. We going to try it. So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board, not my idea. Yes our your favourite. So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo, but I'm going d I'm not going to. I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast w I dunno what I'm going to design. Oh um doesn't oh. Yeah, 'kay. Hmm? I just said it's not my idea but I am the Project Manager, and officially this is my idea. So what? Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose, loosen up, a bit uh meeting each other well uh uh nice yeah. Sh I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because uh this is uh No so a a few legs. Yes yes guess. Well I should make it an hippo now. No I don't think so. Well what is it, huh? Yeah difficult English word. I didn't knew it myself. Our characteristics sum it up. Well it's uh very uh painful those kind of thing. So we can uh just uh We're going back and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal. Huh. Oh uh but this uh marketing designer. what kind of animal is that then? Uh it. Yeah. No no no. What are you going to do? No no. No no save it and start a new uh save it and start a new black uh doc a blank document. Yeah well we have to save everything so now um the next one uh and then save it and start an blank document. Yeah. There's also different colours and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness. So um well you should uh try it but uh Well y y y you could have but uh. It speaks for itself. What the uh just a duck. Nice. Is it a duck? Is it a plane? It doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh. Yeah just a bit a bit childish, a bit. Well uh save the document and then uh And then a a new blank document for. uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it. No well first yeah. And then you go to format I think, and current colour you choose a new colour. And a new pen width uh also format. It's not like in paint. Line width. And you can choose a nice one. Width width. With each other. Yeah. So. Just a wa that's the way we do it's quite easy. Mm-hmm. Oh Pussy. Well then you change it. And erase things. What? Super pig. So Yeah yeah yeah we know. Yes alright. It's a cat. Well well um Yeah save it and start a new blank document. Yep. So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it. Well it's terrific, eh? Yeah that's it. We're one big happy family now. Well then uh the serious uh stuff. We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars, but uh twenty five Euros. Our profit aim is, worldwide, fifty million Euros. So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell. we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so, keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff, and uh marketing uh research. Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls, first about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera? Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait. We can uh take notes and uh Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls? Please? No uh I did. Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yep. That's alright. That would be a nice idea, yes. Yep yep yep. Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit, so. Yes. I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now. Well yeah? No that's right. Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's culture uh international. Yes. Yep, and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player. Don't we have uh other uh ou Uh. We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw. Yeah. Yep. Well yeah. It doesn't have to be, but we can. Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_. Yeah because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design Yes. Yep. Yeah. Oo N we can use uh it as a as a game pad. So one hand has the beer, so the other hand uh Well i we already uh one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market. So the the form will have been uh tested out so Yes. Well for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them. I have uh have to it has to fit my hands. When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here. It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb. Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those. D_V_D_ players. Yes. Well A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand. That's We have five minutes left. So Yes uh that's yep. Yep. Ha. Sound nice. Yes. Well it's just uh about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera. Yes? Yes. Well thirty minutes we have. So um This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh. You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh. I think. Oh and uh that's uh that's all. So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over. Yeah yes say. Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when I've had use it much it was gone. So it has to be made in the buttons I think. It has to uh not be loose. Yeah. Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh It's not that in China it's different? Yeah. But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between Yeah. Probably yes. China rules. Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes. Yeah. Yes. Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it, but you can change them uh when you buy the And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh. Yes. Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell, so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so. Yeah. Well if if you yeah. If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it. I think. But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh. Yes. Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I don't know what your specific instructions will be, but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote. And you will look into the technical design and um form, I think. Or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Euro? Well it it it's if you uh Finish meeting now. Oh alright. Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so In thirty minutes, but uh I think it will be you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here. I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh because uh it's it's the half of the normal size. Oh right, oh. Ma W that was a nice meeting. Yeah, see you.","I've uh made a presentation uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it . Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting .

Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , This is a uh well a drawing board . you have a these different uh functions on the board . So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . Of course w doesn't work any more . We can uh uh well you can save a file . So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Uh just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away . Um you can here select a pen , It's a bit uh childish you have to write . It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes . So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board , We going to try it . Alright , your favourite animal ? I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment . Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose , loosen up , a bit uh meeting each other We're kinda losing time , though . It's a hedgehog . and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal . It's a rabbit . save it and start a new uh These are very important documents , of course , uh these drawings , uh Yeah well we have to save everything There's also different colours and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness . It's just a bird . you choose a new colour . And a new pen width uh also format . It's a cat . Well then uh the serious uh stuff . We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros . Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research . Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ? Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors . Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to well fifty million ? No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise . I also think we should not add too many buttons . Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think . Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something . Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ? and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . And stereo uh s uh audio installations . And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design It has to be different and familiar at the same time . we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped , but that's not uh very recognisable . Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . So one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh but young people want something different Yeah but it's quite important that it fits . one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them . When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here . It shouldn't be boxy . I don't agree with the long box uh shape But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped . No that's ol old fashioned . Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand , A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . It shouldn't be too boxy , you know . but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course , but in in in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh to fit . A big recognisable button on top or something . The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . and maybe we should use colours . Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them , and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs That's kinda trendy . Sound nice . Yes . I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . Well it's just uh about our first ideas now I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make , You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think . So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . Yeah now we can still talk about the material , I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh . Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy . Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things . infrared beams an infrared beam I think . Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ? Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes . and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? You can use it just plain but you can To make it more trendy . And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh Well you can make profit with them , and it's a way to make them trendy . Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell , so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so But people of often don't like bright colours or something . We have to make it grey or s or black . But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh . Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think . Finish meeting now . Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so Next meeting is in In thirty minutes ,"
